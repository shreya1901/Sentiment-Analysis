Still  I decided to finally see this film for the first time and thought I'd toss my impressions into the HUGE pool of information.Jack Nicholson  like the story's author Stephen King  is a school teacher who has quit in order to become a writer. He arranges an unusual job that will give him LOTS of spare time--he and his wife and son will move to a resort in the mountains and be the caretakers during the off-season. This is problematic for several reasons. First  they are all alone and the snow will keep them alone for months on end. So  if there are any problems  they are screwed. Second  Nicholson plays an alcoholic in recovery--and there's no booze in the place. Third  and probably the biggest one of all  is that the place is evil and begins screwing with the family--particularly their weirdo kid and the father. For the most part  the wife (Shelley Duvall) is there to look scared and be preyed upon! I could tell you more about the film....but won't. I don't want to spoil the suspense.I should also note that this is a very adult film. I am not talking about the violence--though it is violent and scary. But the language and very explicit nude scenes make it something you might want to think about before you watch it or let your kids see it.So what did I like about the film? Well the music was great--and REALLY pulled off the scare-factor!! And  the film is quite tense and exciting. I also liked the cinematography. It's odd  though  that the opening scenes shot by helicopter were GORGEOUS but the VERY Obsessive-Compulsive Kubrick (who was known to make a bazillion retakes of scenes) didn't catch or care that you can actually see a shadow of the 'copter in the opening. Look carefully at the bottom right of the screen and you'll see it.My complaints about the film are few. But  I do think that Nicholson's characterization is something you'll either love or hate. I thought he seriously over-acted and agreed with King's assertion that he ALREADY seemed crazed when the film began. King's notion of the problem being related to alcohol are pretty much minimized in the Kubrick treatment---it's much more a film about insanity and evil spirits.I understand that Stephen King hated this particular adaptation of his novel and later he produced his own mini-series more in line with his vision for the film. But  considering he was not yet a big-name author and the god-like Stanley Kubrick was at the helm (and NO ONE tells him how to make a movie)  it was a losing battle from the start. Kubrick helped write the screenplay  produced and directed the film. And  whatever King thought of it  the film WAS immensely successful--at least today when you ask people what they thought about the movie. I'll have to make it a point to see the mini-series as well---even if it currently has a mediocre score of 6.0.So  considering my score of 9  I liked it. Sure  there was some overacting but the basic story is very  very tense and I am sure a lot of viewers were scared half to death watching it. I am not a huge fan of horror films but can sure respect what was accomplished here.By the way  it's interesting that this film is an awful lot like King's later film ""1408""--an awful lot. In ""The Shining"" you have an evil resort and in ""1408"" you have an evil hotel room--both which screw with people and cause death and mayhem--at least in the film versions.",positive

Having seen The Shawshank Redemption  Stand By Me and It and liking all three of them  I knew I should check out the Shining. I did feel that Jack Torrence's hallucinations  apparitions and time-warps were introduced a little too quickly and the build up to the ending was rushed too. But it is very stylishly filmed  making perfect use of an amazing set built at Elstree and a gliding Steadicam  and the music is atmospheric. The story is also effective  and there are really nice touches in the script. Kubrick here tries to be different  and I think he does a superb job at it. The Shining is more chilling rather than shocking  the blood flowing from the doors and the old woman in the bathtub made my hairs stand up on the back of my neck  and is constantly discomforting in an eerie sort of way. Jack Nicolson gives a barnstorming performance as Jack  a performance that is both hammy and disturbing  and Shelley Duvall does decently in a somewhat thankless role. Young Danny Lloyd is superb as Danny  his chanting of Redrum especially became increasingly hypnotic and distorted. The film concludes with a fairly suspenseful ending  and is overall a film with one or two problems and a very loose adaptation but it is a chilling adaptation with Kubrick succeeding at being different. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Part of the reason for that is the professionalism of the director; his cinematography is exceptional  really bringing the Overlook Hotel to life so that it becomes a character in itself.As well as being superb-looking  THE SHINING is both a creepy and exceptionally entertaining movie. It's far more effective than the Stephen King novel on which it was based  purely because it takes a more realistic approach to the material: you can argue perfectly correctly that this is a psychological tale of terror in which all of the events take place in the minds of the protagonists. Gone are the living hedges of the King novels  elements which Kubrick rightly realised wouldn't translate to the screen very well (check out the '90s THE SHINING TV miniseries to see how they did).Kubrick's main beef with the film is that the Jack Nicholson character seems psychotic from the outset  a contrast to his rational character in the book. But Nicholson is what makes this film a real delight to watch; he's a fantastic psycho and probably the most entertaining cinematic psychopath  better even than Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates. Duvall and Lloyd are fine  of course  but it's Nicholson who makes this such a compelling production. Finally  Kubrick throws in plenty of creepy stylistic techniques  like the subliminal images and some truly grotesque imagery  which makes this a chilly  frightening classic and one of the best 'haunted house' flicks in existence.,positive

Before long Jack begins seeing things that may or may not be real.To me THE SHINING is a film that I really didn't care too much for the first time I saw it. In fact  it took several viewings before I'd even call the film good. It took several more for me to love the film and now I'm at the point where I call it one of the greatest movies ever made. I could honestly write thousands of paragraphs about the greatness of this film but I think theories on its meaning and various ideas are already all over the place.For my money what's so amazing about this movie is the sheer terror and atmosphere that Kubrick creates. The entire movie has a very claustrophobic feel to it and no matter how many times you watch it you can sink back into it as if it was your first time seeing it. You may know the story  the twists and what happens but no matter how many times you see it you always feel as if you're seeing something for the first time. That's a huge compliment and I think that's the reason Kubrick's films always work the more times you watch them. I think the film manages to be one of the scariest pictures ever made and especially the scenes with Danny riding around on his bike and running into the twin girls. The creepiness of what Jack finds in one of the rooms is just as good. The various ghostly images that are seen throughout the picture are incredibly effective. Even more impressive is that Kubrick has made a horror film that takes place during the day  in the light and doesn't try to use darkness to build up any horror.Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time and for years people debated his performance here. Many found it to be over-the-top and I used to be one of them but over time I've come to realize that the performance is just flawless. Does it make sense all of the time? No but neither does the story and the two work perfectly together because you mind can go into overdrive trying to find out why things are happening. Duvall  Lloyd  Joe Turkel  Barry Nelson and Scatman Crothers are all very good as well.THE SHINING isn't the easiest movie to watch and there's no question that you must pay attention to it throughout the long running time. With that said  to me it's one of the greatest films ever made and it's one that continues to get richer and better no matter how many times you see it.,positive

He gets a job to watch the Overlook Hotel for the winter with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and child Danny. Danny has an imaginary friend and premonitions of future horrors. The family arrives at the hotel just as it is closing up. Danny continues to have visions. The chef Dick Hallorann is able to communicate with Danny telepathically. Dick calls this 'shining'. Danny asks about room 237 and Dick tells him to stay out. A month later  Jack's writing is going nowhere and he's growing more distance.As a horror  this is not scary. It doesn't make you turn away from the screen. There is not a thrilling drama or an exciting action movie. This is simply art and nothing less. Director Stanley Kubrick is impeccable in his vision. It imparts a mood of foreboding. There is a feeling of wrongness about every scene of this movie. It makes the audience uneasy. There is a creepiness that haunts.,positive

Unfortunately  I had read the King novel just before seeing the movie. There are plot elements that could have been included that would have made this a much better movie. One of the things is ""the shining"" itself  the supernatural abilities of the young boy. The character of Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) is used up with virtually no effect on the plot. I don't know why King allowed that to happen  because it weakens so badly the chance of the victims to escape. The topiary could have been used to a better advantage as well. The way things are  it is too one sided. That being said  I think the Nicholson role is awesome. This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It has enough shadows and manipulation of the supernatural to really be frightening. I loved when Jack was telling the man who hires him what a great opportunity this was for him to work. He's about as wolfy and sly as he can be. Of course  when he finally gets there  the hotel takes over and he begins to become that wolf. One of the most terrifying moments in all of film is when Shelly Duvall   the wife  picks up all the pages he has typed and they are just gibberish. Kubrick plays with us in grand style. I saw the movie a few years after my first viewing  and because the book was behind me  I enjoyed it a great deal more  even though I knew the events unfolding. Kubrick seldom disappoints and this is no exception.",positive

It is based on a novel by Stephen King who was only in his early 30s when this came out. There exist quite a lot versions of this film here and the one I watched is the one common here in Germany I believe  the one running for slightly under 115 minutes  one of the shorter I guess. Today the movie is considered among the modern (can you still call it that?) horror film classics  but there are a few factors that make it an unusual horror film I think. First of all  it is not too common to see really big-name actors in this genre  but lead actor Jack Nicholson was one of the biggest and most lauded performers in the industry back then. Also huge filmmaking legends like Kubrick weren't normally associated with the horror genre. I guess the exception proves the rule with this one.The Razzie recognition is a bad joke obviously. Kubrick's direction was really strong and Duvall did a good job too. Yes her portrayal is reduced to fear and screaming  but it is not her fault that the character is very one-dimensional and lacks in the loving-wife and loving-mother department. Besides  it is quite a challenge to star next to Nicholson  especially back then  and she did not disappoint. A good portrayal. Nicholson of course can let it all out here  like a decade later with the Joker and he is immense fun to watch. The film itself delivers in all departments I think. The soundtrack is good and the visual side is a triumph. The sets in the hotel are a joy to look at and the snow outside is even better. Back to the story  I think the film had several interesting plot twists like the Black cop who seems to be a savior  but eventually only makes the bad guy come off as stronger  an approach used in many later films too (Collateral for example). I still wouldn't call Crothers awards-worthy.I like horror films that are about an invisible danger and even if several creepy aspects are visible and clearly present  I believe that the invisible power that controls Torrance is one of the film's highlights. And the supporting characters are pretty good too  for example the barkeeper or Grady or the twins. Many  many metaphors and symbolisms in here  like the old/young lady in the shower. It is difficult to find something wrong with this one  but if I dig deep enough then maybe I'd say it is not as good on rewatch as on first watch. And that the title isn't perfect because the part about shining is never as crucial as you'd imagine because the son really is never in the center of the film. It's all about Nicholson's character and even a generic title like ""Torrance"" could have been more accurate  but maybe not as memorable. This is probably the Kubrick film that is more for the masses than the others  or most of the others. If you are among the very few who haven't seen it yet  it is high time to change it. My favorite Kubrick and favorite film from 1980  probably not my favorite film based on a Stephen King work though as Darabont's stuff is just too good. Oh yeah final note: I haven't read any of King's novels  so I cannot compare film and book  but let me assure you once more that this is a tremendous movie. Highly recommended.",positive

He has an axe and is about to kill her. My friend responded but she has a big knife  so I guess it is evens.Of course I was too young to actually watch the movie. I only saw it some years later  even then I was not familiar with Stanley Kubrick's filmography.Adapted from a Stephen King novel. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) gets a job as a caretaker at the Overlook Hotel for the winter.The hotel is in the Colorado Rockies where it will be isolated and snowbound. Jack hopes to spend the time writing. He will be there with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny. Danny is a precocious child with an imaginary friend and some visions.At the job interview  Jack is warned that there is a danger of getting cabin fever due to the isolated nature of the job. The previous caretaker was involved in a notorious incident.As the family arrive  the elderly cook Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) shows them around the kitchen. Soon all the staff will depart the hotel.Dick can communicate with Danny telepathically. Over some ice cream  Dick tells the boy of the 'shining' the ability to communicate without opening your mouth and having visions of past or future events.As time goes by Jack starts to unravel and goes slowly psychotic. Danny realises thorough his visions that he and his mother are in danger.The film starts of leisurely with familiar scenes of the Rockies as Warner Brothers inserted them in the ending of Blade Runner. Kubrick is infatuated with the Stedicam as Danny goes around the hotel corridor on his bike.Pretty soon the unshaven  dishevelled Jack shows the famous 'Nicholson' mannerisms. He is unhinged and has visions of his own. Drinking at the hotel bar  talking to the bartender and later a waiter who tells Jack that he should correct his wife and child.Kubrick has made an art house horror thriller (just look at that naked tall  slim woman who clearly is a model.) It is eerie and uncomfortable despite the fact that the British movie poster indicated that this would be a slasher film.Kubrick demonstrates his technical expertise as a filmmaker rather than concentrate on the source material. There is that scene with the pool of blood gushing down the stairs. The climactic chase scene in the snowy hedge maze at night which is curiously lit despite the snow and the hotel being closed. (It is the only way Kubrick could light that scene.)The Shining is unlike the slew of Stephen King adaptations that followed in the 1980s. It is better than many of the King films released in that decade by a country mile.Jack Nicholson gave a polarising performance that split opinions. Shelley Duvall's performance was even more divisive. Wendy is more resourceful than the apparitions in the hotel thought she would. I am not sure about Duvall's acting though. Was it too hysterical or not hysterical enough? I guess as the notoriously fickle Kubrick did not replace her  he was happy with the result.At least with Jack Nicholson he plays it like he was in a darkly comic drama. His performance has been parodied and emulated many times. Even by Nicholson himself later in the decade as the Joker in Batman.The Shining is an uneven film  with a director more interested in the technical aspects of making a movie than the performance and pacing side. I once read that the reason Kubrick did so many takes was that he hoped for some kind of serendipity to spontaneously happen.,positive

He is told stories of the last caretaker going mad and butchering his family but isn't deterred. He arrives at the Overlook Hotel with his wife (Duvall) and child Danny (Lloyd) and is shown around the hotel by the cook (Scatman Crothers) who has the gift of perception. The cook warns Danny that the hotel can be of particular danger for those with the gift. It's only a matter of time before Jack begins to act increasingly erratic.This is one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles  his increasingly unhinged character is amusing and terrifying in almost equal measures. Duvall plays the role of the terrorised wife quite well - she does look like she's genuinely filled with fear - but doesn't have much else to do. Lloyd is excellent as the boy  although he doesn't have too much emotion to express. However no doubt that this is Jack's show.The story doesn't stick to King's novel and is better for it; this is Kubrick's Shining. The film has plenty of genuinely scary moments but manages to keep a creepy atmosphere all through - especially as the ghosts come out and Jack begins to move between his reality and the reality that is gradually claiming him.Kubrick is excellent here  his cold direction adds to the overall creep factor of the film. It's one of the best examples of his masterful touch.Overall this is an excellent horror movie - because the focus is on horror and fear rather than gore alone (as with modern horrors). Jack is excellent in one of his best roles ever and the whole package is delivered in a cold creepy manner by a sadly lost director.,positive

You know the one Stephen King actually likes and prefers to Kubricks version of his novel. But I cannot imagine it being better than this one. And while I have not read the book King wrote (and therefor cannot tell you the differences of how you should feel about King not liking it)  I do like this movie very much.Saying there is attention to detail would be one major understatement. There is a documentary who interprets all the details of the film and goes quite far out at times  but more on that elsewhere. The movie at hand has powerhouse performances. Watching some behind the scenes footage  gives you quite the feeling of what went on.Some may have had issues with the way Kubrick went on to do things  the amount of takes he demanded  the way he behaved allegedly and much more. But the results on the screen speak for themselves. You may not like horror movies and yet still find something here. You also may like horror movies and think this isn't a horror movie at all. It's not easy  but he knows what he's doing and he plays the viewer like a fidel - relax and let it happen,positive

Most of the time I could force myself through a couple of chapters  but every once in a while King's narrative would stimulate the imagination so wildly I'd have to put the book down. Like the Sandy Koufax card in 'Needful Things'  or the clown in the storm drain in 'It'. With 'The Shining'  it was the idea of those dead twin girls inviting little Danny to come and play.I only saw this film once before when it first came out and thought it was a masterful representation of the Stephen King book. Watching today  I thought it was a bit slow and too deliberate at times in it's exposition  with Nicholson's character Jack Torrance a little too over the top in the early stages. But you have to admit  he carries over that crazed catatonic look of Randle McMurphy from 'Cuckoo's Nest' quite effectively. By the time he turns into a would be ax murderer at the finale  he's firing on all cylinders and his manic performance is a wonder to behold.For me  I guess the scariest moment of the film didn't have anything to do with murder and mayhem. It was catching Wendy's (Shelley Duvall) reaction to those dozens of typed pages of manuscript bearing a single sentence over and over again in various iterations. At that moment  you knew that Jack's mind had unraveled to a point of no return and he had completely lost it. Imagine the frustration and paranoia of typing the same thing repeatedly until the mind simply snaps. That was just a powerful scene.Anyway  going back to my opening thought  the idea here would be the same. Try watching this one in the middle of the night with nothing but the TV set on and the room completely dark otherwise. No cheating now  you have to watch the movie all by yourself.,positive

All what happens in the hotel does not make much sense  BUT THEY ALL SEE IT. Specifically  after Wendy locks Jack in the pantry  Grady lets him out. We never see Grady in that scene  but the door didn't just open itself. By the end  we are not sure whether the Overlook is haunted  or whether everyone is having a group hallucination.What about some of the other aspects? When Lloyd serves Jack a bourbon  Jack tells Lloyd ""White man's burden"". What does he mean? Maybe it has something to do with the hotel's history: we heard about how they built it on an Indian burial ground  and Grady calls African-American cook Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers) ""the (N-word) cook"". These two points bring up something interesting: we expect the Indians to take revenge on the white people  but that never happens; also it sort of shocks us when Grady uses the N-word  because we don't really expect an upper-class Englishman to use that kind of word  regardless of his opinion of black people. And the final scene? In a book about Stanley Kubrick  I read that it poses the question ""How independent are we of the forces that govern us?"" Ironically  it happens on Independence Day.As for camera angle  the scene where Jack first (?) meets Lloyd  he's lit from beneath  which illuminates his already ominous features. When Wendy finds ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy""  she is positioned right in the center of the scene and it's red right behind her (Kubrick always makes interesting use of red). Then  what appears to be a POV shot moves towards the chamber  but it turns out not to be; Jack moves into the scene.The point is  ""The Shining"" makes us ask what exactly is up with the Overlook Hotel. We cannot be totally sure. Just a personal note  my parents saw this movie when it first came out. My dad didn't have any problems with it  but it unnerved my mom: Danny looked like my cousin. Creepier and creepier still. This may be the greatest horror film of all time.",negative

However  a maleficent supernatural presence in the hotel eventually drives Torrance dangerously around the bend.Director Stanley Kubrick relates the absorbing story at a leisurely  yet still hypnotic pace  makes excellent extensive use of the sprawling main location  says something profound and disturbing about the horrors of narcissism in which people are too self-absorbed to see the insanity going on in others around them until it's too late  further spruces things up with a wickedly funny sense of pitch-black humor  and adroitly crafts a powerfully intense  oppressive  and unsettling gloom-doom atmosphere that really gets under the viewer's skin.While Nicholson has been fiercely criticized for going way over the top as Torrance from the get go  Wacky Jack nonetheless deserves praise for totally throwing himself into the juicy role and provides a hugely entertaining spectacle when he completely flips his wig in the delirious last third. (It's also the key grim point of the picture that Torrance clearly isn't stable even at the beginning  but everyone else in his immediate proximity is too caught up in their own little worlds to realize the obvious about him.) Moreover  there are sterling contributions from Shelley Duvall as the mousy Wendy  Danny Lloyd as sensitive little boy Danny  Scatman Crothers as easygoing psychic cook Hallorann  Barry Nelson as polite manager Ullman  Philp Stone as the serenely pernicious Grady  and Joe Turkel as friendly bartender Lloyd. John Alcott's sumptuous cinematography boasts plenty of exquisitely fluid and elongated tracking shots. The rattling and majestic orchestral score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind hits the spine-tingling spot. Essential viewing.,positive

When it first came out  the reviews were not so positive  and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today  this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround.Then we have King's disappointment  and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson  and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point  it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty...As for the Kubrick criticism  it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy  stylish film  but maybe not a horror film. It is a great film  but maybe not a great horror film. If you want a good haunting film  for example  ""The Changeling"" has this one beat...",positive

Basically  aspiring writer  husband and father Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) has been interviewed and hired for the job of winter caretaker at the Overlook Hotel. In the secluded Colorado mountains  the hotel is built over an ancient Indian burial ground. The hotel manager Stuart Ullman (Barry Nelson) warns Jack of the previous tragedy  that the previous caretaker murdered his family with an axe before shooting himself  but Jack is unphased. Jack brings his family  wife and mother Wendy (Shelley Duvall)  and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd)  to the hotel. There  one by one  they experience the hotel's dark past with a series of apparitions  hallucinations and time-warps. Danny is confirmed to have ""The Shining"" (telepathic abilities) by hotel cook Dick Hallorann (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest's Scatman Crothers). He sees the ghosts and bodies of the caretaker's murdered identical twin daughters (Lisa and Louise Burns)  and a tidal wave of blood. Jack meanwhile has his mentality deteriorating  having writer's block  and nightmares when he does sleep. Wendy is shocked after Danny has been injured  she says the Danny entered room 23 and was strangled by a woman in the room. Jack investigates  and hallucinates a naked woman in the bath (Lia Beldam)  and when she steps out they kiss. Moments later  she turns into a hideous naked old woman (Billie Gibson)  and he walks out in terror. While hallucinating  he speaks to Lloyd the Bartender (Joe Turkel) in the Gold Room. Jack also has a hallucination of a ball taking place in the Gold Room  where a number of other ghosts appear. The ghost of butler Delbert Grady (Philip Stone) is part of an evil and spiritual presence influencing him he should ""correct"" his family  meaning to kill them. One day  Wendy looks at Jack's manuscript  and realises Jack is insane seeing that on every page he has written the same sentence over and over again  ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"". Jack threatens Wendy  and she bashes him on the head with a baseball bat. He tumbles down the stairs  injuring his ankle  and gets locked in the pantry. When Jack gets out  Danny is in a trance repeating and writing the word ""REDRUM""  in reverse that spells ""MURDER"". At that moment  Jack starts chopping through the door with an axe. Danny escapes through the bathroom window  while Wendy is trapped. Jack chops through the bathroom door and tries to unlock it  but is cut by the knife Wendy is holding. Hallorann is concerned for the family  after hearing about the severe snowstorm  and travels back to the hotel. He arrives at the hotel in a snowcat  and Jack ambushes and murders him in the lobby. Jack chases after Danny through the snow  into the large hedge maze  he loses him when Danny covers his tracks and escapes with Wendy. Jack collapses and freezes to death. The film ends with a photograph on the wall of the hotel's 1921 dinner party  with Jack in it! While this film is not very shocking  it is very chilling and disturbing  especially with the help of a fantastic performance from Nicholson  who is both fun and hammy as the disturbingly unhinged man driven to madness. His finest moment is of course chopping through the door  stopping to deliver the iconic (and ad-libbed) line  the introduction for Johnny Carson on ""The Tonight Show""  and number 68 on 100 Years  100 Quotes  ""Here's Johnny!"" Duvall is alright enough as the emotionally distraught wife and mother terrified of her insane husband. All shot with gliding Steadicam  making the never-ending hotel corridors very claustrophobic  with very good opening aerial scenes  and assisted with very screechy music by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind  this is a brilliantly disturbing horror film. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Director (why?!)  and Worst Actress for Duvall (understandable in a way). Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars  he was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons  he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols  and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor  Jack Torrance was number 25 on 100 Years  100 Heroes & Villains  the film was number 29 on 100 Years  100 Thrills  and it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments.

He is warned that the loneliness can get to some people  he is even told that ten years previously the caretaker had killed his wife and children before shooting himself  but Jack is sure he will be fine. As they are shown around the hotel Dick Hallorann  the head chef  takes Danny aside and talks to him; it appears that they share a gift that he calls 'The Shining'; a sort of telepathy. Once everybody has gone Jack gets down to his writing but it is clear that something isn't quite right; Danny keeps seeing two creepy girls and even has visions of corridors literally awash with blood! As more time passes tensions rise and ultimately Wendy realises that she and her son are in great danger from the person who should be there to protect them. Jack  meanwhile  starts seeing former staff members; he even has a conversation with the former caretaker who explains that he had to 'correct' his family and it is time for Jack to 'correct' his.If you prefer horror movies that have a high body count  inventive deaths and plenty of jumps then this might not be for you; if however you like a chilling atmosphere  a claustrophobic setting and a sense of near constant dread then this is the film for you. While there are few really scary moments there are plenty that are chilling enough to make ones hair stand on end; for example the two girls Danny keeps seeing and the caretaker who calmly explains murdering his family as 'correcting' them. The camera-work adds to the creepiness; often following Danny as he rides through the hotels long corridors or runs through the large maze in its grounds. The small cast does an impressive job; Jack Nicholson is at his scary best as Jack Torrance and Shelley Duvall makes Wendy's terror entirely believable. Young Danny Lloyd does a fine job as Danny. The story might not be told at a fast pace but I was never bored. Overall I'd recommend to any fan of Stanley Kubrick's work or to anybody wanting a genuinely scary chiller.,positive

It's so good that even Steven King's usual pulp horror script can't undo it.From the opening scenes of an insignificant Volkswagon beetle snaking up the deserted road towards an old fortress-like hotel  with an ominous  electronic Dies Irae providing the accompaniment  we know we're in some strange territory. At the wheel of that tiny car is Jack Nicholson who is about to be hired as the winter caretaker of the Hotel Overlook. He brings his family  goggle-eyed but beautiful Shelley Duval  and his cute little son along to keep him company while he does his minimal manual chores and tries to write the great American novel. Things begin to go wrong. The echo of things past begins to make itself heard. Nicholson goes berserk  kills a good Samaritan (Scatman Crothers) with an ax and hunts down his wife and child. Duval manages to reach the snow cat  the only vehicle that can travel through the monstrous snowfall that has isolated them. Nicholson chases little Danny through an intricate maze of thirteen-foot-high hedges  howling and lugging his bloody ax. Danny outwits him  escapes with Duval  and Nicholson is finally left to freeze to death in the middle of the insoluble maze  a more cinematic ending than the novel's boiler room.The hotel is a stage set in England and so is the exterior. But what a set it is. It comes across not at all faked but rather like stylized reality. Kubrik does a fine job. The natural tendency in a spooky horror movie would be to hurry the pace so as not to bore the audience of impatient teens. But Kubrik takes his time. The first hour does little more than introduce us to the characters  just enough information to pique us. The shock scenes are not sprinkled throughout the film but are built up to as logically as possible. Threats don't lurk in the shadows. Everything is visible. And the scenes are sometimes funny. The camera views Crother's TV through his bare feet as he lies in bed  under the portrait of a naked babe with an Afro the size of a medicine ball. His camera placement is original. Often the scenes are brightly lighted and the characters seem to be without makeup and the conversational pauses and hesitations stretched out to the horizon  a self-imposed directorial challenge.And an acting challenge too. Jack Nicholson has been in better films but his performance here has never been topped. There are some long takes during which he speaks to Loyd  the ghostly bartender  while looking directly into the camera. He delivers a superlative slice of ham here and elsewhere  winking  wriggling his tongue at his wife  snorting  making gargoyle faces  acting stupefied. What a performance. Everybody else is good  too  if not quite at Nicholson's level  but of course he has by far the juiciest part.The story is so full of holes that it's hardly worth bothering with them. Something strange happens to Nicholson  let's say. A beautiful naked woman approaches him in one of the hotel's rooms and smooches him while turning into a rotting corpse. Nicholson screams in horror and runs away. When Duval asks him what happened  he says  ""Nothing."" And if Loyd the bartender is a real ghost  and if the booze is real  and if Nicholson's character is really a recovering alcoholic who has decided to get off the wagon  then why does Jack order just one drink and then wander away to join a supernatural party? Why doesn't he say  ""Loyd  give me something simple -- a bottle of bourbon and a straw."" But suppose Nicholson is hallucinating the ghosts? Well  that can't be  either. One of them unlocks the door to the food storage room and lets Nicholson out. And Shelley Duval and little Danny see them too.This doesn't really torpedo the movie. It has too many superlative features to be destroyed. The holes are irritants but not lethal. A good deal of talent was lavished on this lowbrow script. See it if you can.",positive

Wow  what a difference! Now  it's on Blu-Ray and it's really fantastic - the best yet! This is a ""must see"" in high-def.I found it to be very entertaining  very suspenseful and a visual treat. Those visuals were so good that I didn't mind the slow pace. Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role. Shelley Duvall was fascinating with her ""Olive Oyl"" face  smile and soft voice. She got panned by a lot of people  and that was unfair. She's fine. The kid (Danny Lloyd) was good  too  as were the supporting players.The film is typical (director Stanley) Kubrick weirdness but not as weird as some of his other stuff. The only things I personally didn't care for were two blasphemous outbursts by Nicholson and a general unpleasant feeling seeing the innocent Duvall and son terrorized near the end. I did think  story-wise  that Nicholson's character went ""crazy"" a bit too fast. That could have been drawn out more....but I'm not complaining because I genuinely am fascinated with this film.",positive

The struggling writer named Jack Torrance accepts a position as the caretaker of a great summer resort hotel called Overlook during the winter season . But then the writer becomes possessed by it .Having turned down directing a sequel to The exorcist (1973)  Kubrick made his own horror film: The shining (1980)   today regarded as one of the best terror movies ever made. Stephen King (whose novel the film was based upon) reportedly didn't like Kubrick's adaptation . One of 'Stanley Kubrick''s favorite films was Eraserhead  directed by David Lynch   he cited the film as a creative influence during the making of The Shining and screened Eraserhead to put the cast and crew in the mood he wanted to achieve for the film. The director keeps things at a snail's pace   but he carries out scary moments and amazing scenes . Nicholson' s performance approaches high levels . There is a great deal of confusion regarding this film and the number of retakes of certain scenes . According to the Guinness Book of Records  the scene where Wendy is backing up the stairs swinging the baseball bat was shot 127 times  which is a record for the most takes of a single scene. The picture is shot in the Academy ratio (1.37:1) and features shots down the length of tall  parallel walls  the maze and hotel corridors in . And Steadicam operator Garrett Brown accomplished many of the ultra-low tracking corridor sequences from a wheelchair on which his invention was mounted. Excellent costume design by Milena Canonero and magnificent production design by Roy Walker   all of the interior rooms of The Overlook Hotel were filmed at Elstree Studios in England  including The Colorado Lounge  where Jack does his typing. Because of the intense heat generated from the lighting used to recreate window sunlight . To construct the interiors of the Overlook  Stanley Kubrick and his production designer  Roy Walker purposely set out to make it look like an amalgamation of bits and pieces of real hotels  rather than giving it one single design ethic. Kubrick had sent many photographers around the country photographing hotel rooms and picking his favorite. For example  the red men's bathroom was modeled on a men's room in the Biltmore Hotel in Arizona designed by Frank Lloyd Wright  and the Colorado lounge was modeled on the lounge of the Ahwanee Hotel in the Yosemite Valley. Indeed  the chandeliers  windows and fireplace are nearly identical  so much so that people entering the Ahwahnee often ask if it's ""the Shining hotel"". Colorful and luxurious cinematography by John Scott   Kubrick's usual filmed on location in Colorado  Glacier National Park  Montana Going-to-the-Sun Road  Glacier National Park  Montana Saint Mary Lake  Glacier National Park  Montana  Timberline Lodge  Mount Hood  Oregon  (Overlook Hotel exterior)  Yosemite National Park  California and Elstree Studios  Borehamwood  Hertfordshire  England  UK . Creepy and eerie musical score   Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind wrote and performed a full electronic score for the film  but Kubrick discarded most of it and used a soundtrack of mostly classical music   only the adaptation of Hector Berlioz's ""Symphonie Fantastique"" during the opening credits  a few other brief moments survive in the final version . Rating : Above average   it is considered to be one of the history's best horror films . Despite receiving generally unfavorable reviews upon its initial release  the film is today deeply regarded In 2001  it was ranked 29th on AFI list. In 2003  Jack Torrance was named the 25th greatest villain on the Villains' AFI list. This well produced film by Jan Harlan was named the scariest film of all time by Channel 4 in 2003  and Total Film had it as the 5th greatest horror film in 2004. The motion picture will appeal to Jack Nicholson fans and Stanley Kubrick buffs .",positive

And despite it being from 1980 then the movie still holds it own by today's standards  both in storytelling  terror factor and as a wholesome movie.The movie is every bit as thrilling and disturbing as the book. And that accomplishment is well-owned by the director  but also to the actors who were in the movie.The story told in ""The Shining""  which I assume that you should be more than familiar with already - and if you are not  shame on you  is about Jack Torrance  a former teacher turned writer  who takes on the responsibility of being the caretaker of the Overview Hotel as its secluded location makes it impossible to reach during the snowy winter months. Locked away at the secluded mountainside hotel  the desolation plants a seed which is fermented by the isolation and the Torrance family find that strange things take place at the quiet Overview Hotel.Running at 2 hours and 26 minutes  ""The Shining"" might be a bit too long for some viewers  especially since this is the type of horror movie that slowly builds up the dread and suspense. So don't expect to be thrown into a movie filled with scares from the very beginning.And it is this slow and foreboding building up of dread and suspension that really makes ""The Shining"" such a great movie  because it is done in a very skillful manner. And the progression of Jack's descent into madness is so amazing to watch on the screen.""The Shining"" is also the movie that really made me open up my eyes to the acting talent of Jack Nicholson. He is nothing short of spectacular in the role of Jack Torrance. And his mannerisms  charisma and physical appearance is so well-cut for this particular role. It really felt like the character was custom made with Jack Nicholson in mind. I can't really claim to be familiar with Shelley Duvall other than her work in ""The Shining""  but she really did a good job in this movie right alongside with Jack Nicholson.The setting for the movie really also adds a lot of depth and atmosphere to the movie. The Overview Hotel is a grand spectacular building in itself both outside and inside. And its secluded location in the mountains just adds so much to the feel of isolation and desolation that permeates the movie.""The Shining"" is an effective horror movie because of the build up of the isolation  dread and terror. And director Stanley Kubrick really cemented himself in the horror history with this 1980 movie. I dare say that he put a timeless horror classic to film with his accomplishment here.I am rating ""The Shining"" a well-deserved 8 out of 10 stars. And I can honestly say that ""The Shining"" is a movie that you can watch again and again with a few years in between.",negative

Occasionally  though  Nicholson's crazed appearance and unmistakable mannerisms are perfect for his role  adding credibility and weight to his performance; such is the case with The Shining  in which the actor plays writer Jack Torrance  who  under the influence of evil spirits  slowly turns from family man to murderous axe-wielding nut-job. Never has Jack's wicked grin been so perfectly suited to a character—not even for the Joker.Of course  it doesn't hurt that the man calling the shots behind the camera was one of the finest film-makers to have ever lived—Stanley Kubrick; if anyone could get a convincing performance from Nicholson  it was going to be Stan. With an unforgettable central turn from its star and flawless direction from Kubrick  The Shining is one of the best horrors of all time  offering stunning camera-work  unsettling music  iconic visuals  and scene upon scene of unbridled suspense and terror. In fact  it's so scary that I find I can even overlook (pun intended) Shelley Duvall's freakishly large eyes and scary teeth  and that's saying something!,positive

How many times have I personally seen this film and what can I do to add to the conversation? That's why I held off on writing anything about it  but after watching the new 4K version of the film at the Carnegie Science Center's Rangos Giant Cinema - which features a 70-by-38-foot Certified Giant Screen  two industry-leading Christie® laser-illuminated 4K laser digital projectors and a premium Dolby Atmos®surround sound system with 45 speakers - I felt like I saw it again for the first time.When projected across a screen that large  even the smallest moments in this film take on a dizzying new life. From the initial lone drive through the trees and mountains to the Overlook to being able to see every pore of skin on faces in the film's numerous close-ups  the perceptions of the way that you traditionally view this film have been changed  which enables you to see it differently. Stephen King has famously hated the places that writer/director Stanley Kubrick took his story  even as this year's Dr. Sleep will be presented as a sequel to both the King book and in canon with Kubrick's visionary masterwork.The issue that King has always had is that Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is evil right from the start of this film instead of being driven mad by whatever lurks inside the gigantic hotel. King was struggling with alcoholism as he wrote the novel  so you can understand how personal it is to him. He felt that the two main themes of the book - the disintegration of family and the dangers of alcoholism - aren't really present in the film.He also had issues with the casting of Nicholson  reasoning that audiences wouldn't be surprised when he'd go over the edge  and disliked the way Shelley Duvall played Wendy  saying  ""She's basically just there to scream and be stupid  and that's not the woman that I wrote about.""He's also gone on record about how the movie downplays the supernatural and I think that that claim is bogus. If anything  the movie is more otherworldly  presenting a place where even the physical space of the hotel cannot be trusted. He said  ""What's basically wrong with Kubrick's version of The Shining is that it's a film by a man who thinks too much and feels too little; and that's why  for all its virtuoso effects  it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should.""I must have been watching the wrong film all these years.That said  like any movie worthy of being watched multiple times  The Shining has all manner of explanations for what it's really about: the history of America  the Holocaust  the treatment of Native Americans  Kubrick's role in the mission to the moon and so on. I'm always struck by the nature of duality: the past caretaker named Grady followed the same path that Jack is on - and he's always been at the Overlook and if we follow the photo at the end  so has Jack - but they have also both had a moment where they could change their destinies. Yet was their destiny to just be the monster? In King's book  Jack becomes that monster. In Kubrick's  to quote Laura Miller's interpretation  the director is the monster  guiding his characters toward a conclusion while watching them in the same way that Jack watched his wife and child in the maze  from above  as if they were insects.To back this up  there's the fact that Nicholson and Duvall have expressed open resentment against the fact that Kubrick received sole credit for the film's success above and beyond the efforts of the crew and the actors. Nicholson has gone on record saying that Duvall's performance is the most difficult he's ever seen an actress take on.That may be because of Kubrick's mercurial nature. For the scene where Jack finally breaks through the door with the axe  there were hundreds of takes and over sixty doors used over three days of filming. Sure  it's an iconic scene  but that many takes had to ruin nerves. And the scene of blood coming out of the elevators took an entire year to get right.There's also an interesting duality in the difference between Jack in the book and in the movie. Book: a man struggling to remain sane; movie: an insane man struggling to seem sane. Duality is an intriguing concept when it comes to film  as the set of one movie is often the same set in another. For example  The Shining's Colorado Lounge is also the Well of Souls from Raiders of the Lost Ark. And much of the fake snow made for this movie ended up on Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back.Even more duality - composer Walter Carlos was transitioning to become Wendy Carlos as this film was being made. As a kid  when I'd go through my father's many Moog and synth albums  I always wondered if they were married or brother and sister. I didn't learn the truth until I was older.Fueling even more strangeness is the fact that this is also a movie with three unreliable narrators. Jack  Wendy and their son Danny are all trapped within a place that warps reality and presents images that may or may not be real. Jack is seeing these visions through the eyes of madness; Wendy through her cabin fever and Danny as a child interprets the reality of adults.The unsung hero of all of this is Scatman Crothers  who had a rough time on the film  often needing a hundred takes for each scene. If you ever watch Vivian Kubrick's documentary Making The Shining  you can see just how emotional he is. When he moved on to make Clint Eastwood's Bronco Billy as his next film  he broke down in tears of gratitude on his first scene in the film. Eastwood  famous for often only needing one take  had to be such a welcome relief for Scatman. Yet even in the briefest of scenes that he appears in  he owns the moment  even when juxtaposed with the acting power of the two leads. He's also the only objective adult voice in the film - you can argue that every single other person inside the hotel could be a figment of the imagination.As a writer by trade  however  I often see Jack as a sympathetic character. My wife continually tells me that I react like him to interruptions  but to anyone that doesn't know the sheer terror of writer's block and the amount of time that it takes to feel ready to write and that inspiration takes hold  anything that gets in the way honestly feels like the worst physical pain possible. The Shining is one of few depictions of this feeling I've ever seen that gets it right. And even when you write your heart out  often it just looks like the same words written on a page over and over and over to the uninitiated. Nicholson said that when Jack snaps at Wendy  that scene hit home. He'd often been in a similar situation when girlfriends had interrupted him and drew on those feelings when he added the line that makes this scene sing: ""If you come in here and you DON'T hear me typing  if I'm in here that means I'm working!"" Writing isn't just the actual act of putting the words down. I feel like I'm in the throes of writing  editing and dealing with how people react to my words on an endless cycle.Even the keys of the typewriter are authentic  with the actual sounds of the keys typing ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" being hammered out. Kubrick's assistant spent months typing and retyping those words without the aid of a Xerox machine. And in each country  different words are used:Italy: ""Il mattino ha l' oro in bocca "" which means ""He who wakes up early meets a golden day.""Germany: ""Was Du heute kannst besorgen  das verschiebe nicht auf Morgen "" which says ""Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today.""Spain: ""No por mucho madrugar amanece más temprano"" or ""Rising early will not make dawn sooner.""France: ""Un 'Tiens' vaut mieux que deux 'Tu l'auras' "" which translates to ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.""However you see The Shining  whatever your interpretation  I feel that you are correct. Works of true art and vision are able to do this  to take on the feelings and emotions of the viewer and reward others with your interpretation.",positive

Jack Nicholson interviews to be the winter caretaker of a mammoth  isolated Colorado hotel and immediately feels at home in the lonely vastness of its eerie expanse; his jittery wife and muted  psychic young son aren't so sure about the surroundings  especially after Dad starts exhibiting uncontrolled behavior. Once again  Kubrick displays his fabulous grasp of film-technique  resulting in some sensational scenes (particularly the opening drive up the mountain  the child's first meeting with the psychic cook  the overhead shot of the maze  and a funny/scary bit with Shelley Duvall fending off crazy Jack with a baseball bat). Unfortunately  the plot is all gummed up; it takes in past and present incidents  characters as mind demons  and a boy's fear of his father and fails to make all the elements cohere. Worse  the pieces don't make this much of a scary puzzle--it's too confounding to be truly terrifying--and the finale (filled with lots of freaky goings-on) releases all the tension Kubrick has worked so hard to build up. Some may see the confusing debauchery and the blood-filled elevator as Kubrick's comment on the horror genre  his imperviousness to the usual scare-movie tactics--he's above clichés--though what he DOES give us doesn't add up. A great deal of screen-time is spent getting help to the woman and her son (in the form of the cook) and also in locking up Nicholson when he becomes too violent--and both chapters end ridiculously. Was Kubrick gleeful at cutting such corners? If so  he shouldn't have been. ""The Shining"" feels like a cheat in so many ways that frustration ultimately mitigates the suspense. **1/2 from ****",positive

Alien is simply wonderful  with imaginative production design especially and a magnificent score from Jerry Goldsmith. The pace is also right on the money with a purposefully slow build-up  the editing is great  Scott's direction is superb and the story is wonderfully structured with seldom a dull moment. The script is also thought-provoking  clever and well written  while the atmosphere is just spellbinding with a perfect mixture of false scares and genuine jolts. The acting is also top notch  Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ellen Ripley  who is not only one of the most iconic characters in film history but a contender for Weaver's best ever role.

It's a film that came along at just the right time  proving to be an antidote to the kind of kiddie-friendly sci-fi that was popularised by STAR WARS during the period. While this first film in the long-running series has since been overshadowed by a superior sequel (Jim Cameron's ALIENS  one of the best sci fi/horror/action films ever) and a third film that nearly equalled the highs found here  it's nevertheless a hugely entertaining movie that works thanks to a simple  straightforward plot line that offers maximum terror  all of the time.One thing it isn't is original. The likes of this go back to the 1950s and earlier. Essentially it's one of those 'old dark house' films of the '30s  transferred to a futuristic spaceship. One film  a '50s B-movie - IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE - has almost exactly the same plot as this film  while Mario Bava's sci-fi outing PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES has the same visual look. Yet ALIEN isn't about originality  just old-fashioned scares executed in a clean  professional manner. This is a film of shadowy corners and dark spaces  of menaces and monsters lurking in air ducts  ready to kill and do worse to you at a moment's notice. It's still terrifying to this day  and the atmosphere is helped no end by an effective soundtrack that includes a beating human heart to up the tension.Technical qualities are superior and the cast is great. There's a pleasing tendency to kill off random actors regardless of their status which means you can't second-guess who's going to bite it next. Stand-outs include Sigourney Weaver  transforming here from a faceless crew member to a tough heroine  a remarkable progression that carried on into the sequels. Tom Skerritt is perfectly cast as the good-natured captain while Yaphet Kotto steals the show as the hard guy engineer. In fact  all of the cast give excellent turns and a role for Ian Holm early on in his career is a real standout.Another plus is the scary  sexual design of the alien stuff by H. R. Giger. The facehugger is the stuff of nightmares while the alien itself is probably the pinnacle of man-in-a-rubber-suit technology; there's certainly been nothing scarier than the creature you'll see here. Great pacing  excellent effects  and an underlining realism combine to make ALIEN a genre classic and a film that's been rarely touched by the rip-offs that followed. One for the collection.,positive

They go down to the planet to investigate only to bring back something dangerous.The story is a fairly simple creature feature in a spaceship. Ridley Scott took that simple story and gave it everything needed to make a new standard in sci-fi horror. Before it the sci-fi horror is the mainstay of B-movie schlock. After it the genre reach a new golden age. The same way that Star Wars pushed the envelope  the same can be said of Alien.The atmosphere is fantastic. Ridley Scott has packed in some iconic scenes. Who can forget the meal scene? It's going down in movie history. That are some movies that transcend a simple movie. This is one of them.,positive

From the planet these junk dealers come to  to the appearance of the monster and subsequent events  this is one wild ride. First of all  there is a bleakness and an eeriness. These people are on a salvage mission  trying to bring things back to sell. They have been victimized by their own bosses. When they go down to the planet  they have not been told what lies there. There is a darkness to everything. It isn't the romantic explorer thing of a Star Trek or the use of a sophisticated starship. This is a big space barge. When the man is brought back from the surface with that thing on his face  we know that there is something coming. The scene following is one of the most startling and disgusting I've ever seen (in a positive way). The alien is a true threat  dripping corrosive venom and poison blood  terrorizing the ship  leaving one person to combat it. If there is a more claustrophobic  terrifying movie than this  I'd like to know what it is. The other Alien movies don't quite make the grade because they draw on way too much of the same thing and it seems forced.,positive

It is all about what happens when an alien creature ends up on a spaceship full of scientists in the future. Lets just say that it is not full of scientists anymore at the end. The movie won an Oscar for its special effects and scored another nomination. These days  despite being almost 40 years old (or because of?)  it is considered a classic when it comes to combining the horror and sci-fi genres. The most known cast member is certainly lead actress Sigourney Weaver and she keeps moving more and more into the center of it all the longer the film goes and there are other pretty well-known actors in the relatively small cast here. Still  this is at no point an actors' movie. It is all about the creature  the fight for survival and of course the technical aspects (both visually and audibly). And last but not least about the scare factor: I think they did a pretty good job here in elevating this film beyond mediocre jump scares as the creature attacks sometimes when you don't expect it and does nothing when you do expect it like when the second victim was looking up at the ceiling in search of his cat.Some solid plot twists about crew members and the general plan involving the creature work in the film's favor too. You have to dig deep for flaws  but here and there you find one. Maybe Ripley is sometimes depicted too heroically for a film that definitely tries to go for realism at the very core of it all. I also could have done without the epilogue outside the ship I guess  but I'll accept it for the thrills. Just personal preference though obviously. It was a good watch  but almost top50 films of all times (as here on IMDb) is certainly exaggerated. I will probably check out the James Cameron sequel at some point too  but these two hours were not on a level where I would want to do it immediately. Overall  a thumbs-up though. Certainly worth checking out if you love sci-fi. A lot was done right here and there were certainly scenes that could have gone horribly wrong with less competent people in charge. Lucky for us  they did not. Go see it.,positive

""Star Wars"" gave us Carrie Fisher. ""Alien"" gives us Sigourney Weaver. Even though Tom Skerritt is the top-billed star  it is Weaver whom you'll be watching all the way through  and while she certainly has a legacy outside of this  it is obvious that say her name in fifty years  an alien will be the film that people remember her for.A group of astronauts and an Android are on a mission in space when they are alerted that their assistance is needed on another ship that is claiming SOS. After debating whether or not they should go  they head out to help  and realize that the SOS was actually a warning. When they get aboard  they discover that the ship has been taken over by some sort of Horrid creature who aligns itself onto one of the astronauts faces  and the acidic like droppings from it become deadly. Another astronaut all of a sudden has a spasm with a creature popping out of his chest  and before long  they are fighting for their lives.Among the crew are humans Veronica Cartwright and John Hurt and android Ian Holm  and while perch has several memorable moments  unfortunately  his role is nothing more than a cameo. Home  as the Android  is unforgettable with or without body attached to head. But Weaver is definitely the star  commanding and strong  yet brave and fearless  and certainly somebody I would want on my side during a dangerous predicament like this!While you get to know the characters  if not so much from their words as it is from their actions  because the script does what it needs to do without being too wordy. The special effects are sensationail and the direction is tense and sheer perfection. Ridley Scott creates a tense atmosphere that never lets up  aided by Weaver's cat who gives a little warnings whenever the alien is around. There are plenty of moments that will make you jump  but that is followed by laughter from the situation. Who would think that a film like this could have a sequel every bit as gripping  and for some  even better? But this is where it started  and it is a film that will stand the test of time long after this review has faded into the list of many others written about it.",positive

It's difficult to forget what you've seen  but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young  the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret  Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent  while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton  Kotto  Hurt  Skerritt  Holm)  but of course the real star is the one we see least of.We barely see the alien in full detail  most of the time it is set in shadows  moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg  moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level.",positive

Sci-fi horror was treated to something new and different here  with scenes and concepts that were truly unique that hadn't been done before. I still think back to the time I saw the picture during it's original theatrical release  and marvel at the idea of the chest-burster for example. And I can't tell you how much the scene with Ash (Ian Holm) that revealed his robotic form blew me completely away; it was almost too difficult to concentrate on the rest of the story. Then there was the title character itself  a creature assuming horrific proportions through the same process of metamorphosis that transforms caterpillars into butterflies  but here done with complete disregard for the norms of natural evolutionary process.What's striking in watching the film today is how both timely and timeless it is. Timely in that as a product of the Seventies  the set design seems almost minimalist  to the degree that sci-fi films of the 1940's and '50's were dated to reflect the technology of those periods. Timeless however in the constructs that work to achieve their intended effect in the mind of the viewer  a fear of the unknown and a fascination with fantastical creatures that have a right to exist only in our imagination. Something as simple as Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) picking up the reptilian shed skin of the chest burster claws away at one's mind  forcing the viewer to consider what might be in store for the survivors of this mission. Speaking of which  I haven't seen any comments on the role of the spaceship on this board. There was a point in the movie when it began to emerge that the Nostromo itself became a hostile entity to the crew. 'Mother' herself appeared to have  in the words of many a 'Star Trek' episode  a prime directive of it's own  that of investigating and securing alien life forms. Was there a more chilling moment in the story than the words Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) read as Mother's response to her question about the nature of of Nostromo's programming? - ""Crew Expendable"". So it's thirty years since the release of ""Alien""  and the film is just as fascinating to watch today as it was that long ago. Granted  some of the early going is a bit slow in the delivery  but as a set up to what follows it's a wait that's made worthwhile for the suspense that builds and reaches a crescendo in the second half. I'll take this one head and shoulders over any number of present day efforts that attempt to dazzle the audience with over the top action and mind blowing special effects  each successive effort attempting to outdo the one that came before. With ""Alien"" you have the real deal  a story and a creation that stands the test of time to emerge as an icon of popular movie and cultural entertainment.",positive

From the moment when the egg attacks Kane (John Hurt) to Ellen Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) battles against the title character  this movie has you tensed up every second of the way. You may be very suspicious of every movement around you after watching this movie.Obviously  what made ""Alien"" so great was that it had a woman going all bad-ass on a big ugly creature from another world. You probably know about the ""chest"" scene (or maybe you've seen a spoof of it)  but you have to see it to believe it! All in all  this is a great movie. Weaver turns in a top-notch performance  and great support from Hurt  Harry Dean Stanton  Yaphet Kotto  Ian Holm  Veronica Cartwright and Tom Skerritt  add to the movie's high quality.

The premise ingeniously mixes elements from two separate  yet compatible genres into a strong and satisfying synthesis. The futuristic outer space setting is pure sci-fi  but the grotesque monster  ghastly gore and spooky mood are sheer gut-wrenching horror all the way. 2.) The plausibly drab and bleak depiction of a frightfully possible future. There's nothing slick or shiny about the future shown in this picture. It's truly grim and grimy  with the grungy set design  grubby costumes and rundown looking spaceship all contributing to one fascinatingly credible version of a future that seems just around the corner. The all-powerful company's cold assessment of the crew as expendable isn't too far removed from the world we currently live in -- a world in which greed and money take precedent over the basic worth ascribed to everyday human life. 3.) The gradual pace. While there are some folks who take issue with the methodically slow pace  said pace nonetheless is crucial to developing the almost unbearably substantial amount of suspense that really kicks into harrowing overdrive once the creature gets lose on the ship. It's the meticulous build-up of the first half which gives the second half of the film its considerable nerve-wracking impact and potency. 4.) The infamous ""chest-burster"" scene. It's so supremely well-timed and staged  with highly believable mixed reactions from everyone involved in the scene. 5.) The uniformly superlative acting from a top-notch cast. Sigourney Weaver positively shines in her break-out star-making role as tough sole survivor Ripley  with stellar support from Tom Skerritt  Yaphet Kotto  Ian Holm  John Hurt  Veronica Cartwright  and the always terrific Harry Dean Stanton. 6.) Jerry Goldsmith's exceptional score. Ace composer Goldsmith chimes in with one of his most brilliantly spare and chilling scores ever. 7.) The thoroughly convincing warts'n'all human characters. The way the well-drawn characters bicker and interact with each other rings completely true throughout. 8.) The strikingly gloomy cinematography by Derek Vanlint gives this feature a supremely powerful dark'n'shadowy atmospheric look. 9.) The still quite sound and cogent special effects. Done prior to CGI  those miniatures have an organic quality to them that's extremely persuasive. 10.) That hideously vile  nasty and downright creepy alien itself. Sure  it's just a guy in a suit  but wow does that suit seem incredibly genuine and lifelike. 11.) Ridley Scott's faultless direction never wavers from start to finish  keeping the absorbing story on track while delivering plenty of jolts and cranking up the clammy claustrophobic tension to the often exhilarating ninth degree. Add all these sterling factors together and the net result is a simply spectacular motion picture that's wholly deserving of its classic status.",negative

Face hugging  chest popping and outright carnage ensue  as one by one the crew is left to fend for themselves.This film goes down as a classic  and it well should have. A giant in the sci-fi world directed this (Ridley Scott  ""Blade Runner"") and it was written by Dan O'Bannon (who also adapted ""Total Recall"" from Philip K. Dick and wrote/directed the horror classic ""Return of the Living Dead""). And a cast consisting of Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm? Amazing! What makes this film great is the real sense of being alone it leaves you with. Even when the crew is grouped together  they know they're trapped millions of miles from home. They must fight to survive  no running possible. The enemy changes and remains unknown  and even one of the crew may not be on their side.This film contains the iconic ""chest-popping scene""  which was pretty cool. Granted  after seeing ""Spaceballs"" you might be let down by the version in this movie  but it's still pretty memorable. The face-huggers are also creepy  if you can imagine what that must be like to have a slimy  acid-blooded creature suctioned on your face  dropping eggs. Nasty! The film goes from sci-fi to horror and back again  mixing the two together in way that's rarely successful (although I would give a nod to ""Event Horizon"" for being a fine exception). They implement the ""final girl"" scenario well. I don't mean to ruin the plot for anyone  but not many of the crew survive and one of them is Sigourney Weaver (which I suppose is obvious since she's in all the sequels). She knows how to be tough  even if she's not exactly pretty while doing it. (I think horror fans crave attractive women more than science fiction fans do  if this film is any evidence.) My only complaint with this film is the alien suit  which seemed too rubbery and human-like. Luckily  the director was smart and saved the reveal until much later in the movie and kept it to a minimum. Sometimes the unseen is scarier than the seen  especially if you aren't able to make the monster as scary as you planned (which is fixed in future sequels).If you haven't seen this one  see it. It sets the bar for all future science fiction films  particularly ones involving hostile alien life. I don't know if a film in the genre can be made any more without somehow paying their respects to this one.",positive

Basically  the commercial towing vehicle  Nostromo  is heading back to Earth  when they receive an SOS signal from a nearby planet  and they are under obligation to investigate. They have a bad landing  but three of the crew members  Dallas (Tom Skeritt)  Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) and Kane (BAFTA nominated John Hurt) leave the ship to investigate. There they discover a hive colony of unknown creatures  the computer message was not an SOS  it was a warning. One of the eggs is disturbed  and a parasite (face hugger) attacks and attaches itself to Kane's face. Dallas and Ash (Sir Ian Holm) do try to get it off  but its defense mechanism of acid for blood and the possibility of killing Kane (because it is feeding him oxygen) stops them. Soon though  he seems fine and this creature has detached and died. The pinnacle scene is where all the crew have dinner  and Kane starts coughing and struggling in pain  till his stomach suddenly gushes blood  and the alien (or Xenomorph) is born (looking pretty phallic). It grows very quickly  and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) is first to be attacked by the big  double-mouthed  acid dribbling alien. The crew plan to kill the creature and escape in the shuttle  and one by one die trying to find it. Ash also grossly reveals himself to be a android with the ""special order"" to bring this alien to Earth for scientific discovery. Eventually the other crew members  Lambert and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) are killed  till the commanding officer  Ripley (BAFTA nominated Sigoureny Weaver) (who grew a bigger character as everyone else died) is the lone survivor  along with cat Jones  and sets the Nostromo to self destruct and escapes in the shuttle. The alien was not destroyed though  but eventually she gets it out of the blast door  sucked into outer space  and blasted by the shuttle rockets. She concludes by making a report of the situation  with hope she will be picked up by the company  and she and Jones go into the pod for hibernation. I have also seen the 2003 Director's Cut version  but the only real major change is seeing Dallas cocooned  and a few chats  and many interesting scenes and moments cut out  I think the original version is much more interesting and essential. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects  and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration  it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Sound Track  and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Jerry Goldsmith  Best Costume Design and Best Editing  and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Sigourney Weaver was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars  John Hurt was number 27 on The 100 Greatest British Actors  Ellen Ripley was number 8 (Hero) and The Alien number 14 (Villain) on 100 Years  100 Heroes and Villains  the film was number 6 on 100 Years  100 Thrills  it was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments  it was number 11 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die  and it was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Films.

At the start of the film they are awakened from hyper-sleep and are surprised that they aren't back at Earth as planned but in a strange system where they have intercepted a possible distress beacon's message. When they investigate they find a strange alien ship that appears to have been there a very long time  the pilot has fused to his chair and his ribs are broken in a way that suggests he was killed from the inside.As they continue to explore the ship Kane (John Hurt) discovers a room full of strange leathery pods  when he touches one it opens and a strange creature jumps out  burns its way through his helmet and clamps itself onto his face. Back on the shuttle they attempt cut it off only to discover that the creature bleeds an acid so strong that a few drops burn through several of the ship's decks. After a while the creature detaches itself and dies for no apparent reason. When Kane awakes he is very hungry and wants a good meal before they go back in to hyper-sleep for the return home. During this meal the alien makes its dramatic appearance as it bursts out of Kane's stomach to the shock of his colleagues. The rest of the film follows their attempts to kill the alien which for some reason one of the crew appears to be protecting.Unlike most other science fiction films of its time Alien doesn't feature a spaceship with gleaming white surfaces instead it is a dirty claustrophobic vessel which is clearly a work horse and far from new  another difference with other such films is that the hero of the story is actually a heroine in the form of Ellen Ripley played by the excellent Sigourney Weaver in her first major role. The rest of the cast are also great as is the design of the alien  by only showing bits of it at a time it never looks like a man in a suits so remains terrifying till the end.If you've yet to see this film and like horror or sci-fi I strongly recommend that you give it a go.,positive

It's been redone any number of times as a war movie or a Western.  Now it's in outer space.  The sub-genre looks something like this.  A small contingent of people -- a mixed group -- in an isolated situation are confronted with a rarely seen enemy who strikes out of the darkness.  There is no way to fight back effectively.  One by one  the group members are picked off  beginning with the leader.  This shifts the responsibility to the next in command  who turns out to be the lone survivor or  sometimes  the last to sacrifice himself or herself for the sake of the mission.But it's hard to recognize the basic plot under all the gloss.  This movie was something of a shocker on its release  and introduced a lot of innovations into SF movies.  For instance  in all earlier movies in which a team lands on an alien astronomical body there is no wind.  Here  there is a howling gale.  This may not seem like much  stated so baldly  but no one had thought of it before  although it's long been known that planets like Jupiter have atmospheres that are in a state of constant turbulence.
The monster was also a vehicle for a new  slimier conception of raw evil. This one is no Gill Man or furry pet with teeth.  This thing is positively reptilian in its detestability.  And it doesn't just ""do away"" with its victims.  It begins by incorporating every revolting image from our worst nightmares -- a scaly muscular skate-like creature that plasters itself to John Hurt's face and embeds itself in his innards in order to plant a seed of some sort  which later develops into a juvenile that  in a famous scene  bursts out of Hurt's chest during a shipboard dinner that didn't look very appetizing anyway.  This was the first movie that could really turn one's stomach  what with jelly-like substances and gooey sounds.  Everything connected with the alien looks as if it belongs under a rock in a jungle. The f/x are outstanding.  If they look a little tired today it's only because they've been so often imitated.The performances are professional all the way down the line.  Sigourney Weaver has a strangely boney face and tiny mouth  but she's believable and turns in a good performance  especially for a Stanford graduate.  Her first name was plucked by her father from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel  ""The Great Gatsby "" one of my faves.  Tom Skerrit isn't around that long  but he is so likably easy-going that we hate to see him disappear from the plot early on. John Hurt is a fine actor.  He was my supporting player in the art-theater classic  ""From the Hip.""  He's never done less than a first-rate job. Whatever happened to him?  Veronica Cartwright exudes vulnerability.  She needs protection as an adult as much as she did when she was a child in ""The Birds.""  In an interview she revealed that when the juvenile creature first appeared everyone laughed at it because it looked so much like a penis. Ian Holm as the robot is suitably cold.  He's a good Shakespearian too. Yaphet Koto is an earthy comforting presence -- while he lasts.  The alien itself doesn't have much screen time but makes the most of it  dripping all over with what looks like saliva.  It reminded me of a boatswain's mate I once had the misfortune to serve under.There are a couple of curious things that shouldn't get more than footnotes. The music is almost all taken from Howard Hanson  a moody and underrated composer  and effectively evokes distance  darkness  and the mystery associated with them.  There are also a couple of references to Joseph Conrad thrown in (eg.  the name of the ship is the Nostromo) for reasons I can't figure out.  Maybe the writers or the director just happened to like Conrad.  It should also be noted that Sigourney Weaver's figure  while not bursting with femininity  is sleek and smooth and looks designed for underwater swimming.If you haven't seen this  you should probably try to.  The gross factor isn't very high  viewed from today's perspective  so if that's what you're looking for  rent Carpenter's regurgitative newer version of ""The Thing"" or something.",positive

It's just too interesting to ignore.The attractions are the incredible suspense; excellent photography and set design and memorable horror scenes. They didn't overdo the action scenes  either  as is so often the case with modern-day films. In fact  some of this might be too slow-moving for today's audience.The suspense  as crew members search for the killer alien  is almost unbearable at times and helps make up for the profane cast  all of whom are low-life people who would never be astronauts in real life. I personally applauded when Veronica Cartwright  who had one of the nastiest faces and mouths on screen  met her demise. The rest of the crew wasn't much classier. Since this movie came out  in fact  the sequels to this plus many other science fiction films seem to portray astronauts as trashy people which is the opposite of reality and just plain ludicrous.Anyway  Alien a memorable movie to anyone who has seen it. Who can ever forget the alien emerging from John Hurt's chest? That's a scene that stays with you forever. Others have tried to imitate the horror of that scene  but never quite been as successful.The restored DVD gives this 25-year-old film a new appearance. It looks fabulous and really highlights the great cinematography and superb direction by Ridley Scott. This is just great entertainment if you want to spend a night on the edge of your seat.,positive

And despite actually being from 1979  then ""Alien"" is the type of movie that transcends time and keeps being interesting and can be seen again and again.I am not going to delve too deep into details about the storyline  as I assume that everyone is already familiar with ""Alien""  as it is such a massive giant in the Sci-Fi genre. But briefly summarized  the crew aboard a massive commercial space vessel responds to what might be a distress call from an unknown planet. And when going to investigate  a strange organism attach itself on the face of one of the crew. And after a short time in isolation and as the creature comes off  things seem to be back to normal  an alien creature bursts through the chest of the man  unleashing a dangerous creature to roam the cramped confines of the Nostromo.What makes ""Alien"" a great movie is the way it is directed and the way that director Ridley Scott manages to build up some great suspense which all are brought to satisfying conclusions and climaxes. And there is a nice sense of fear and claustrophobia aboard the ship as the crew realize the peril they are in.And much credit also go to the cast in the movie  as they really did good jobs with their respective characters and roles. The cast list includes great talents such as Sigourney Weaver  Tom Skerritt  Harry Dean Stanton  John Hurt and Ian Holm.""Alien"" introduced a very iconic creature which really took hold in the Sci-Fi horror genre. And the design by H.R. Geiger is nothing short of spectacular and really works so nice on the screen. The design is scary  disturbing and fascinating at the same time.While the creature is very interesting  then director Ridley Scott did a good job at not over-exposing it on the screen. And that really helped to build up the suspense and the dread that permeates the movie.If you are not already familiar with this 1979 Sci-Fi horror classic  then it is about due time that you take the time to sit down and watch it  because it is the grand introduction to a great franchise.",positive

Alien follows the luckless crew of the space-tug Nostromo  who are re-routed by their ship's computer when it picks up what seems to be a distress signal. Following the suspected S.O.S. transmission to a desolate planet  they set out to investigate the wreck of an alien craft unaware of the horror that awaits them.Whilst Alien is essentially just a 'monster on the loose' movie (albeit with a big-budget) what makes it such an effective film is the loving attention to detail in all aspects of its production: the script (by Dan O'Bannon) presents us with a set of well developed characters who react believably to their unusual situation; the set design makes the claustrophobic Nostromo a totally realistic working environment for a crew on a long space haul; and the alien (based on concepts by H. R. Geiger) is a convincingly nasty critter which rapidly grows from a toothy chest-bursting snake-thing into a 7ft bio-mechanical monstrosity.Scott takes his time developing the story before getting down to the really good stuff  his slow-burn approach allowing the viewer to familiarise themselves with the characters and drink-in the stunning visuals. But when things do start to go pear shaped for the crew of the Nostromo  he cranks up the tension to breaking point  delivering non-stop suspense and shocks right up to the closing credits.The film also benefits from a very talented cast: the brilliant John Hurt is Kane  the poor schmuck who becomes a human incubator for the monster after poking his nose too far into an alien egg chamber; a young Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley  the tough heroine of the movie; Ian 'Bilbo Baggins' Holm is the nasty science officer Ash; and Tom Skerritt  Veronica Cartwright  Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto play alien fodder.Occasionally Scott relies a little heavily on mechanical scares (Jones the cat is responsible for a few too many false alarms) and some elements require a little more explaining for very picky folk like me (such as 'how the hell did a face-hugger manage to latch on to the big 'space jockey' alien seen in the wreck?')  but seeing as we get to see Sigourney Weaver in the universe's teeniest pair of pants  I'm willing to overlook these trifles and award Alien a whopping 10/10.,positive

We didn't have a lot of time for movies and we never got around to seeing this in the theater.Fast-forward to 2010  a re-release of this movie plus the next three in one complete set on BluRay disk  along with two extra disks of extras. A total of 6 BDs. I found that my local public library has the set and today I watched this one. I will watch the other three over the next week or so. Being on BluRay the sound and picture are first-rate  worth seeking out for fans of these movies.The movie has a fine cast of mostly well-established actors but I will only focus on one  Sigourney Weaver in her still iconic role as Ripley. Set somewhat in the future  as the movie begins we see that a merchant spaceship is traveling back towards Earth after a mining mission  the crew of seven are in hibernation pods. The pods open  the crew awakes  and we soon find out it is premature  but for a specific reason. A signal  possibly from intelligent life  is detected from a nearby moon and the ship is preprogrammed to wake them for a possible mission  to investigate for life forms and bring specimens back to Earth to study.They go and in the exploratory mission in fact encounter an alien life form that attaches itself to the face of one of the crew  forcing them to bring the alien back to the ship to save the man. This ultimately creates a number of really serious issues and soon survival of the crew is at stake.This of course is a very well told story and a very well made movie  indicative of its high IMDb rating.SPOILERS: For my own recollection. The crew members  one by one  are killed by the alien as it grows in size and reasoning. Ripley finally realizes only she can escape and must blow up the mother ship and its cargo to destroy the alien. As she sets that in motion and retreats to the smaller escape ship  once there she finds the alien has stowed away there also.

This first enstallment in the Alien saga is quite creepy.  In this original (one good thing is the original though inspired by It! the Terror Beyond Space) tale  a group is summoned to a planet by a distress signal and a creature comes on board that starts to kill off the crew one by one.  As a thriller  this film only packs it in small doses  unlike its sequel.  But  as a sci-fi epic that tries to grab us with memorable scenes (alien out of stomach is my fav) it works. Scott makes a good effort here  but it can't be helped by It's acting  just by it's amazing (for it's time) effects and Alien design (famous HR Giger provided).  A,positive

What do you do? You fix it straight away  obviously! After all  it's ""only"" the greatest and most effectively claustrophobic sci-fi/horror milestone ever made. It's ""only"" one of the handful of movies that sparked your fascination for ugly monsters and grisly bloodshed. It's ""only"" the quasi-perfect role model movie that spawned numerous of tasteless & exploitative rip-offs that you love just as dearly. And  last but not least  it's ""only"" the sole cinematic classic that always remains just as intense and petrifying regardless whether you watch it for the first  second or forty-ninth time.Everything about ""Alien"" is near-perfect. Even after 40 years  the film's monumental tagline is still the greatest ever. ""In Space no one can hear you scream"". Ain't that right! I know that many mega-fans and pseudo-cinephiles want to make a lot more out of it  but in essence ""Alien"" is a very basic and straightforward ten-little-Indians plot  set on a futuristic spaceship with a stowaway monster on board. Ridley Scott  nor writer Dan O'Bannon  never attempted to make it any bigger than this  and that's part of the beauty of it. Scott and O'Bannon also quickly demonstrate they are a perfect match! They clearly share an obsession for production design and special effects  which is particularly illustrated during the opening 10-15 minutes that almost look like a big-budgeted remake of ""Dark Star"". The minimalist pacing and dialogues efficiently increase the uncanny atmosphere.But  evidently  the most unforgettable moments in ""Alien"" involve the nightmarish and utterly repulsive phallic-like space demon. The moody lair with the eggs  the infamous chest-explosion sequence (undeniably one of the most iconic horror sequences ever) and the nail-biting cat & mouse hunts throughout the ship; - all these scenes are literally oozing with suspense. The performances of the ensemble cast are sublime  without any exceptions  but ""Alien"" specifically skyrocketed the career of Sigourney Weaver. And deservedly so!",negative
49,Alien,1979,R,1h 57min,Horror; Sci-Fi; ,22 June 1979 (USA),8.4,762793,1423,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/reviews/_ajax?ref_=undefined&paginationKey=,https://resizing.flixster.com/Kz1Jl8aEV-OGmvLWEuRkWop7JPc=/206x305/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p2571_p_v8_al.jpg,0,Different Worlds,27-Jun-01,Different WorldsSpoilers herein.I've just rewatched `Alien ' `Aliens' and `Alien Resurrection.' Considered simply as films  each is a fine film but they come from worlds that are more different from each other than the normative world of now is to the world of any of them. Just viewing them is a course in filmmaking.Ridley Scott's `Alien' is the most impressive  knowing that it was only his second film  that every effect is physical  and that the budget was so low the spacecraft is cobbled together from used aircraft parts. Even at this early point  Scott has the ability to create a unique look and has the mastery of craft to coordinate every element (acting  score  movement) to reinforce that look. That he chose Giger to base the look on was brilliant. Organic darkness -- evil embodied in living things. The alien ship  though only briefly shown  is a sequence that will live way past the time that the monsters of the series are forgotten; that blending of beast  environment and narrative is unique in all filmdom. Really amazing that the sequels didn't go back to that ship. Scott has grown to be one of our best and most original filmmakers -- Alien and `Blade Runner' (with `Forbidden Planet') are the very best `real' scifi films we have  meaning films that are not just adventure films.Where `Alien' is scifi in the service of horror  `Aliens' is scifi in the service of action. Aliens is a war film  and equally impressive as one of Cameron's earliest. Movement and conflict. More emphasis on the familiar is necessary for this approach  so we see the sets and costumes less adventuresome. This is a thrill which uses the trappings of scifi only as another thing with which to impress. The mood created is projected not into the image as with Scott  but into the theater as something to amaze. Cameron hasn't evolved at all from this film  only been given ever bigger effects with which to amaze. So one might consider this his most `genuine' film.`Resurrection' seems to not be as admired by the fan base. But I think it every bit the equal of the other two. In this case  we also have a new director  a European with two fantasy tales under his belt. But those set a tone that is strikingly weird: the tone not in the setting  but in the psychological space in the story. And that's what we have here. In Cameron's film  every character is a stereotype. Here  every character is an anti-stereotype: the black guy isn't jive; the cripple is the toughest; the sex kitten is a robot... even the hero isn't really. This is also the most cinematic use of the camera  using the psychological eye. Scott dwells  Cameron moves  Jeunet examines. He doesn't mind annotating the past films (rather like Van Sant's `Psycho' annotates Hitchcock's).The only negative thing I note in the sequels is that Weaver isn't adaptable enough to understand and get behind these diverse visions. She understands Scott. Cameron doesn't really care  but she is outclassed by Jeunet.Seeing any one of these enhances the appreciation for the other two.,positive

It stars Tom Skerritt  Sigourney Weaver  Veronica Cartwright  John Hurt  Yaphet Kotto  Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.The space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...Back on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979  backed by a terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all  the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film  could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.On plot synopsis it's standard format  where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand  and it becomes a battle of survival in one location  it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street  no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home  this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.Some still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn  yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway  and lonely one would guess  so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced  lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying  the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid conventions.With art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles  the whole piece has a disquiet about it  notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders  Alien across the board is a visceral experience  especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.It made a star of Weaver  who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character  another masterstroke by Scott  with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form  there's no showy stars in here  a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.Now 40 years old  Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status  and rightly so. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10,negative

Nowadays zombie movies are ten-a-penny and zombies are in the public consciousness alongside vampires and werewolves.But WORLD WAR Z offers something new: the first  straight  big-budget zombie blockbuster. Sure  PLANET TERROR skirted with the premise but with a sci-fi twist  while this is straightforward zombie stuff. It's based on the terrible Max Brooks book of the same title  but don't let that put you off; unlike the book  it actually has a structured narrative  and characters.And I loved it. I'm not normally a fan of CGI unless it's done right  but it's done right here. Scenes of the zombies attacking en masse are brilliantly conceived  and the set-piece that takes place in Israel in the middle of the movie is simply phenomenal. It's a film that also manages to be vicious and frightening without being gory  which is a fine achievement. If you thought the infected in 28 DAYS LATER moved fast then you haven't seen anything yet! Sure  the characters are thinly-sketched  but that matters little as WORLD WAR Z follows an action-thriller template. Brad Pitt's lead is both the luckiest and unluckiest guy on the planet at the same time  and the film never deviates from getting up close and personal with its undead menace. The worst thing about it is Marc Forster's fuddled direction  something that also spoiled QUANTUM OF SOLACE  but it's not a big enough to detraction to stop this from being anything other than a solid film.,negative

On his mission he must travel across the globe trying to see what might work in the human's defense of the zombies. I'll admit upfront that I haven't read the book that this film is based on so I can't comment on if it butchered the book or if the film got it right. That aspect of the conversation just doesn't bother me but what does bother me is that we've got an insanely high budget and yet they couldn't work out some sort of interesting story. For the most part we just see Brad Pitt going from one beautiful location to the next and we see that the once beautiful place is now full of zombies. Every once in a while Mr. Pitt has to walk through dark hallways and what really hurts the film is that these sequences just aren't scary. In fact  I'm going to say it right out loud that there wasn't a single scary moment to be found in this picture and the entire ""disaster"" aspect of what was going on just didn't work for me. Never did I feel that the world was really coming to an end and this is a big-budget that can't pull this off yet look at what someone like Romero did in no money. Another problem is that the zombies are all rather bland whether they're real effects or the majority of them CGI. They're not scary  no creative and the lack of gore shouldn't be bashed because you don't need gore to be scary but at the same time when you have the violence off-screen it just makes the film seem rather childish. Pitt offers a nice performance but this is certainly far from his best. It was nice seeing David Morse and the rest of the supporting players are good as well. I don't know what was wrong with the final third of the movie where they had to go back and film a new one but what we got here just doesn't work as its too slow and boring. WORLD WAR Z  sadly  is delivered as a very disappointing movie no matter if you're familiar with the original source or not.",positive

They manage to escape and Gerry is put to work on finding the origins of the outbreak. This Brad Pitt showcase has many good points. My only main complaint is the PG13 rating which imposes the cartoon zombie action rather than a gore bloody fare.The action starts right away within 10min. There's no need to misunderstand what this movie is. It's simply a popcorn movie. Although unlike other post-apocalyptic movie  there isn't the standard eerie empty city scenes. The zombie mystery is investigated in a Bond movie fashion. Brad Pitt travels all around the world following leads. It's actually easy to follow and really compelling. It has a good tension filled horror aspect. It's not all big action. You also get good scary parts with dark hallways and stalking dangers.,positive

Well the virologist takes a nasty fall and Pitt ends up in Israel and later Wales where he might have discovered a chink in this worldwide pandemic.World War Z is an adaptation of a popular book but liberties were taken with the adaptation  especially the ending as the original cut of the film was deemed to be too grim.The film has great scenes of panic with zombies on the loose  zombies attacking as a team as in Israel but some of the lines and scenes make you wince with its cheesiness and lapses in logic.This does not mean its terrifically entertaining. The film starts off the blocks with a bang  there are some visceral scenes depending which cut of the film you have seen and it does rack up the tension.It is rather refreshing to see a film being so successful when it had such public post production issues.,positive

Out of the blue  they witness several car crashes caused by the attack of hordes of zombies. Gerry runs with his family and he steals and drives a RV  heading to Newark  New Jersey. Gerry calls his old friend  UN Secretary General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena)  who promises to send a helicopter on the next morning to rescue Gerry and his family. Gerry stops at a supermarket to get supplies and medicine for his asthmatic daughter and the RV is stolen. They flee to an apartment building and a Latin family helps them  lodging the family in their apartment.On the next morning  Gerry invites the family to go with them to the roof  but they prefer to stay in their apartment. However they are attacked by zombies and the boy Tommy joins Gerry and his family in their runaway. The helicopter brings them to an aircraft carrier anchored offshore New York City and Gerry is assigned to travel to South Korea with the virologist Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel)to seek out the patient zero to develop a vaccine. When the team arrives at the base  they are attacked by zombies and Fassbach panics and has a fatal accident. Gerry has a conversation with an insane ex-CIA agent (David Morse) that is imprisoned and he goes to Jerusalem to talk to the Director of Mossad Jurgen Warmbrunn (Ludi Boeken) to learn why he built a wall and transformed the city in a safe zone. When Jerusalem is attacked by a horde of zombies  Gerry observes that the zombies do not attack terminally ill persons. Now he travels with his escort Segen (Daniella Kertesz) to a research facility in Wales to disclose his findings to the scientists. ""World War Z"" is a refreshing zombie movie  with a tense story full of action. I know that the movie is not faithful to the novel  but the plot is a combination of zombies and virus movies and entertains. The characters are likable and the special effects are top-notch. Matthew ""Jack Shepherd"" Fox is wasted with a minor role but in accordance with a research in internet  his character would have an important role in ""World War Z""  having an affair with Gerry's wife and taking care of his family during his journey seeking a cure to the epidemic. The dark ending  with Karin trading her body to survive  was changed by Paramount to a commercial (and probably better) conclusion. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Guerra Mundial Z"" (""World War Z"")",positive

As a result I put off watching World War Z but I was still interested in seeing such a big budget zombie film. The plot sees some form of outbreak and  well  you know what happens. No sooner has Gerry Lane rescued his family from one city  than he is rescued by his old UN employers who want him to help lead a mission to try and find a solution by escorting a doctor to South Korea. No pressure  but the space for his family in safe haven does rely on him saying ""yes"".After some very brief character establishment (references to ""old job""  happy family image etc)  we get the first of many set-pieces as an outbreak sweeps across the city and  like many of the set-pieces  it is pretty good stuff. There is plenty of money on the table  lots going on and the scale of it all is suitable for a plot about a global outbreak. The problem is that it never really feels like more than this and the bits in between are not great. The biggest criticism that I can offer is that it did nothing to be other than make me watch the noisy scenes in the way I would with any big blockbuster – and I remind you that I am normally chilled by zombie movies. Here I felt that apart from once or twice  it didn't really do the tension or the horror well  it almost felt too slick  too expensive.To give a contrast  an outbreak in a closed car park in 28 Weeks Later was really horrific to me (in a good way) but here the one on a plane didn't bring that same feeling. It is hard for me to put my finger on it  but for sure something was missing here. The plot doesn't help – jumping around the world without much linkage and asking the viewer to just go with it; perhaps I would if I had cared more  but everyone apart from Brad Pitt seemed so disposable – just fodder for the attack shots  so I did get numb and also feel remote from it all. Technically it is great and it really is well shot and put together  but it is just the lack of atmosphere that hurts it the most.It is a big expensive movie though and as a blockbuster it works well enough to give it a go  but it really never works in the ways that would have made it a much superior film.",negative

I am still scratching my head on that one.Brad Pitt who is now a family man  must save the world to save his family. There is some background noise that would indicate the zombie outbreak might be caused by how man destroys the environment and ignores the signs (global warming  wink  wink  nudge  nudge.) The world is thrust into anarchy  while the military exists.Brad must look for the original virus somewhere in the world to find a cure. We discover N.Korea is unaffected because they pulled everyone's teeth. Israel is unaffected because they have a great wall around their country  but apparently cold isolated places like Greenland are infected. The only reason I point out these inconsistencies is because the film writers went to great length to make the film realistic. Oh yes  if you have a lot of people on a ship  they share beds and sleep in shifts.I enjoyed the film more as a pandemic film than a foot dragging  flesh eating  living dead  rotting zombie film  because that is what it was. I would say if you don't like Brad Pitt  don't see this film. There is very little screen time that doesn't show his face.

I can only say that I was surprised that I liked the movie. And from what I heard it was the most successful movie Brad Pitt has done so far (Box Office wise that is).So while it was only PG-13 in the cinemas (there will be an extended cut available on Disc soon)  it still had a few punches to deliver. Mostly emotional but also action wise. While the director wouldn't have been associated with Horror prior to this  he did a really good job conveying the terror and the tension that builds up in a situation that is depicted in the movie. It is pretty straight forward and therefor somewhat predictable I guess. But I thought they would be aiming at another ending.And if you have heard about the history of the movie you know that they actually re-shot 30 minutes. The last 30 minutes of the movie. Maybe it is apparent to some  maybe not. Shouldn't be a distraction or something that will disable your ability to enjoy the movie though,positive

The categorization is not wrong  but kit changes what we typically think of when we mean zombies. These are not lumbering oafs. These are lightning-fast creatures that seem to have some sort of collective intelligence  like a colony of bees. Their abilities (most notably climbing walls) are foreign to what zombies are.Also  this should be seen as an action film first  horror film second  which seems to be the case any time Hollywood has millions of dollars to burn on a zombie film. See  for example  ""I Am Legend"". If you are looking to see Brad Pitt survive car accidents and plane crashes while traveling around the world (South Korea  Israel  Wales) this is a fine film. But if you want some scares or a film that embodies ""survival horror""  you will not get what you want.Probably the most clever thing about this was the referral of zombies as ""rakshasa""  a Hindu demon that feeds on human flesh. Maybe this has already been covered in Bollywood  but it seems that the concept is rather new here. The zombies (or infected) in this film are not actually rakshasa  but it does raise the question: where are Hindu demons in the horror film? If we can have Onibaba and other Asian creatures  why not something from a country with over one billion people? But this is a bit of a sidetrack...Anyway  good film if you want big budget action and Brad Pitt fighting computer-generated undead while sporting the greasiest hair since Kid Rock. Bad film if you want slow  lumbering Romero zombies. But to each his own  I guess.",positive

Basically former United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is stuck with his family in a heavy traffic jam in Philadelphia  and on the radio they overhear a rabies outbreak spreading worldwide  and then all of the sudden explosions go off and people start biting and attacking other people  these are zombies. People bitten become a zombie after 12 seconds  and after escaping the disaster  and spending the night in the safety of an apartment  they are picked up by a helicopter sent by Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations  Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena)  also Gerry's former UN colleague. They are taken off the coast of New York City to a U.S. Navy vessel  and the analysts and military personnel discuss the outbreak  Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel) says it is a virus they must find the origin of to find a cure to those infected as zombies. Gerry  being expert as a former UN investigator  is sent to investigate  he is given the dilemma that if he does not agree his family will be taken off the vessel  and the team travel military base Camp Humphreys in South Korea where the word ""zombie"" was first heard. After getting out of another attack he is informed by survivors that the zombies are attracted by noise  and that the best way to kill them is to shoot or hit them by the head and incinerate the body  and imprisoned for treason former CIA operative Gunter Haffner (David Morse) tells him to go to Jerusalem  Israel. Once there they meet Mossad leader Jurgen Warmbrunn (Ludi Boeken) who explains about troops some time ago fighting against undead soldiers  and following this the country quarantined itself  but they still allow all nationalities of uninfected civilians to enter  and due to the noise from inside the zombies manage to climb the high wall to get in and attack. During the attack Gerry noticed certain civilians being ignored by the infected  and he escapes with escort soldier Segen (Daniella Kertesz)  who is saved from infection having her bitten hand amputated  but on the plane a zombie stowaway attacks  forcing a grenade to be exploded  causing suction for the infected  while the passengers are safely belted  but the craft crashes. Gerry and Segen seem to be the only survivors  and they reach their diverted destination  a W.H.O. (World Health Organization) research facility in Cardiff  Wales  and to the scientists Gerry explains his theory that the zombies will not bite people already seriously injured or specifically terminally ill  as the host would not have a virus spread and reproduce  he says it is not a cure  but is could work as camouflage. He volunteers to try and get to the wing containing a range of terminal but curable pathogens to inject himself and try this theory  but the wing is surrounded by infected zombies  so he and two others make their way as quietly as possible without obvious detection to the wing. Gerry makes it to the storage vault while the other run and get out before the door is bolted  he injects himself with a sample and waits a few minutes for it to spread in his body  and he opens the door to a zombie who simply looks at him and walks past  and he successfully walks through the facility without any zombies trying to bite him. In the end Gerry returns to his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and two children in the safe zone in Freeport  Nova Scotia  a vaccine is created to be supplied worldwide for people to inject themselves and become camouflaged from the infected  soldiers are able to kill and incinerate the masses of zombies  and humanity continues. Also starring James Badge Dale as Captain Speke and Lost's Matthew Fox as Parajumper. Pitt is I agree a bit too calm most of the time  but he is a reasonably good choice as the man trying to help stop worldwide chaos  I also agree that there is not enough bloodshed in this film  most zombie movies you would blood and guts all over the place  and there are no big scares  but the story has good ideas about pandemic solution  and the conclusion to the problem is clever  it is exciting enough to enjoy with its special effects as well  all in all a likable action horror drama. Good!",positive

When his former boss calls he realises that the only way to guarantee their immediate safety is to return to his old job as is promised that his family will be kept safe on a ship far from danger. After a struggle against the zombies they get to a helicopter and fly to the ship. Once there Gerry learns that the disease came to the United States from a base in South Korea. He flies there with a disease expert hoping to find the first case. Once there things don't go well; the doctor is killed and it becomes apparent that there is no way of finding the first case. He does however hear that Israel has managed to stay disease free as they built a massive wall shortly before the zombie pandemic swept the world. Gerry gets back in the plane and continues to Jerusalem only to find its defences are breached shortly after he arrives. He does however notice that the zombies ignore a handful of people; this leads him to come up with a plan to save humanity; it won't be easy though and if he isn't careful his cure could be just as fatal.People expecting a full on horror movie may be disappointed as it lacks the gore most zombie movies feature; it does however manage to keep tension high from the opening scenes to the films conclusion. The fast moving hordes of zombies are pretty scary as they flood through the streets like a pyroclastic flow. The story is a bit episodic as Gerry moves from Philadelphia to New Jersey to the ship to South Korea to Israel and finally to Wales but that isn't a problem; each location presents different problems for him to overcome. There are some moments that are a little bit too unlikely  even in the context of a zombie apocalypse  most notably when Gerry and a young soldier he saved in Israel are the sole survivors of a plane crash! The cast does a solid enough job; Brad Pitt in particular in the role of Gerry Lane. The film's end is merely the 'beginning of the end' and a sequel is inevitably in production. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting an intense but not particularly gory time.,positive

There were aspects and parts of the movie that were really great and nice  while other aspects and parts of the movie were quite the opposite.First  let me start off with the things that I didn't particularly cared much for. The biggest issue for me was  of course  the running zombies. I never have cared much for agile and running zombies  nor will I ever get to do so. Sure  I can understand it in this movie as the infected was recently turned. But that leads me to the second issue in the movie which I didn't appreciate or understand. If everything here happened in the course of 2-3 days and the zombies were ""fresh"" (read  recently turned)  then how come they all looked emancipated and like they had been decaying and decomposing for about 2-3 weeks? It just didn't make any sense.Also the massive pile ups of zombies as they stacked up to scale the walls in Israel of the sides of towering apartment buildings  that didn't really go well with me. Sure it looked cool and it was a new concept idea to bring to the genre. But come on  it was just too much.Without giving away anything of the ending of the movie  then it was really  really anti-climatic. It was like the movie producers realized that they were over the estimated time-slot and budget and had to wrap it up quickly. The ending was abrupt and too much of a happy Hollywood ending.So what was good about the movie? Well  there was an overload of action  right from the very first minutes and up to the very end. There is a lot of adrenaline and speed to the movie. And it worked out well with the panoramic views of the various cities  when you saw all the infected running around in massive hordes. It was on an epic scale actually. I loved those scenes (eventhough I can't stand running zombies). They looked awesome and there was just something dark about them and a sense of looming doom.The scenes in Philadelphia and Israel were fantastic  they really made good use of the locations and the cinematography here. Great shots and a good sense of panic here in the scenes. However  when the movie went to Korea it was a bit anti-climatic. The military airport in Korea came off as something from a distant era. It was all dark and in small  enclosed areas most of the time. You didn't really have the sense of this was a military area in one bit. And when the movie took us to the viral facility in Ireland  well that was just great. Sure  it was in sterile rooms and long corridors lit up by florescent lights  but it worked so well.As much as I don't really consider myself a fan of Brad Pitt  then he actually did a good job in this movie. However  there weren't really any over-the-top performances in ""World War Z"" from anyone. People did good jobs with their given roles  but no one in particular stood out. The characters they portrayed  however  tended to come off a one-dimensional and you never really got to the heart and core of any of the characters. As such  they were very impersonal and could just as well just had been hollow caricatures.I am giving ""World War Z"" a 6 out of 10 rating  because it is a good action movie full of adrenaline  but there were gaps and holes in the storyline and continuity here and there. And also the running zombies didn't help to impress me. There are many beautiful scenes and really well-constructed scenes throughout the movie which makes the movie well worth watching. ""World War Z"" appeals to a wide audience  but in its attempt to get out to as many as possible  it fails to cater to the hardcore fans of the zombie genre.I should get around to reading the book  as I have been told that the movie deviates and strays far from the actual book upon which it is based.",positive

But with the film released on DVD in an unrated version  curiosity got the better of me  and to my surprise  I really enjoyed what I saw.The script isn't perfect  certain plot developments being hard to adequately explain  and Brad Pitt's character must be the luckiest sonuvabitch alive to survive so many encounters with zombies (and a plane crash!)  but disengage the brain and accept the less likely aspects of the story and there is a huge amount of fun to be had with this spectacular  fast-paced horror offering.Lots of brilliantly realised scenes of zombie mayhem  delivering plenty of scares and tension  go to make World War Z a thoroughly thrilling flick from start to finish  with the superb set pieces including a breathtaking race to the top of a tower block  an awesome 'zombie swarm' in Jerusalem  and the discovery of a stowaway zombie on a packed jet in mid-flight. Throw in a few superbly executed jump scares and what you have is a hugely entertaining movie  despite the questionable moments in the narrative.,positive

In fact I would normally not see them because to me they are just overly silly. The whole concept of ""the undead""  people getting bitten and literally in 10 seconds or so changing into a Zombie. Stuff for cartoons but not for a serious dramatic movie.The one exception is ""Warm Bodies"" which I saw during this past summer  a story about Zombies wanting to become normal people again  I really like that one. Anyway  to this one  ""World War Z"". It seems some type of mysterious virus has broken out somewhere  they believe Korea  and via our connected world has spread quickly through air travel. And these Zombies that result are not the clumsy  plodding Zombie usually portrayed. No  these seem to move a bit faster than usual  act as if they were a rabid animal  and snap their jaws as if they were trying to eat someone as quickly as they could. It is not a good situation  and the whole world is threatened. Brad Pitt is Gerry Lane  retired UN specialist who only wants to be with him family  his wife and two daughters. But when their own city  Philadelphia  becomes overrun they have to escape towards New York and end up taking refuge on a military ship. But against his wishes Gerry is virtually forced to help them track down and try to eradicate the Zombie disease  otherwise they could not give his family refuge.So that's really what the story is about  Gerry traveling first to Korea  then to Israel  then to a W.H.O. installation in Wales  barely surviving a plane crash. He has to save the world  otherwise no one will.I like Brad Pitt  and he is good here in what to me  is a pretty silly movie. I found myself laughing occasionally  not because killing people is funny  but just the absurdity of the Zombies and their zeal to overrun everything. Just light entertainment and nothing more. It tries to strike a meaningful note at the end  but it just didn't work for me.SPOILERS: Gerry does save the world  at least it is moving in that direction as the movie ends. At one point he had noticed that mysteriously the pursuing Zombies simply avoided certain humans  just bypassed them. He theorized that those were sick humans  and Zombies somehow could detect that  and only wanted healthy human bodies to spread their Zombieism. So he further theorized  if he were to inject himself with a disease-causing virus  the Zombies would avoid him. It worked  and the solution for the world would be mass inoculations with disease  that could then be treated to save the person  but also allow them to gradually eradicate the Zombies. Interesting concept!",positive

Yeah  I miss those days too Ever since the modest British hits ""28 Days Later"" and ""Shaun of the Dead""  zombie cinema turned into a big and profitable business. In less than a decade  we were literally overloaded with far too many uninspired zombie splatter flicks and incredibly lame zombie comedies. These days it's getting even worse  as the living dead have now also become mainstream material and we have A-list directors unleashing big-budgeted splatter flicks and former poster boy actors like Brad Pitt fanatically smashing zombies' brains! ""World War Z"" fundamentally isn't a bad film  of course It benefices from its elite production values and its professional cast & crew. And since zombie movies used to be intended for restricted target audiences  I can imagine that the screenplay still has quite a lot of suspense and surprises to offer to the bigger movie-going public. However  if you have been watching zombie flicks your entire life already  the script of ""World War Z"" has absolutely nothing original to offer and every next sequence or supposedly shocking revelation is very predictable. Horror fans will have seen it all before and numerous times  albeit realized with much smaller budgets and thus cheesier special effects In fact  not even that  because ""World War Z"" evidently is a PG-13 movie and thus there isn't much carnage or bloodshed on display  and whenever Mr. Pitt crushes a zombie's face with a crowbar or something  it occurs off-screen. Every tiniest story detail about ""World War Z"" is either preposterous or derivative. The virus outbreak and the subsequent mayhem in the busy streets of Philadelphia  the families torn apart  the quest for the virus' origin and the so-called patient zero and even Brad Pitt's groundbreaking solution to hold off the zombies it's all very predictable. And whenever the script isn't predictable  it's downright absurd  like for example Brad Pitt and his Jewish lady sidekick surviving a plane crash that cannot be survived. The quote in this user comment's subject line is spoken by an acclaimed virologist in the film  Dr. Fassbach  who's allegedly the savior of mankind and heads out to South Korea with a full team. He's clearly full of himself and thinks he's very intelligent  but then he trips and shoots himself through the head That actually was the best part of the film. That  and the Israeli zombie wall",positive

What mattered to me were three things done well:The transition from normal life to the human waves was jarringly effective. What I expect is a traditional zombie story. Some explanation and setup is given for the impending invasion and then we encounter the unrelenting but slowly moving threat. Here  we have a different formula: one we have tested with Tom Cruise and Will Smith: we are involved in everyday tedium and then bang! Explanations come later.How do you innovate with this  make it more compelling? You leverage the effect mentioned in a moment. A tsunami builds. No one knows what is happening. You only know that people are desperate to flee at any cost and the panic is the initial horror. What could cause this? The pacing is perfectly timed to outrun our ability to absorb what is going on  just as it is for our on- screen folks.Even in the midst of this shared confusion  we note that our hero has a different relationship to panic. (We know he is the hero only because he is Brad Pitt and that this film is produced by him for himself). He alone seems to absorb what is happening faster than anyone else  including us. We see him notice without knowing what he is understanding.This is the highest level of craft  it seems to me  focused on the hardest part of the story  the beginning.A second notable feature is what got this movie made  I suppose. The threat  at least in the first 2/3 of the movie  the original bits  is not zombies but zombie waves. Elsewhere I have written about using architectural water as a threat. A major advance was Perfect Storm and later Titanic where water could be given behavior  personality. Then we had Hereafter  where Eastwood directed a tsunami with intent.What we see here is mobs rendered as flows  and the CG processes being those used for water working against gravity. There is genius in this as well  and a genuine advance in the art. (This comment is on the two-d version. I cannot see how a three-d-ization could improve anything.)We also have a couple sections of good writing (noticed by my writer partner). These are placed where we expect to hear boring exposition  something about military labs or space probes. Something dreary but necessary. The first instance is with the Harvard genius who we are told is our best hope for understanding. he gives a speech instead about the capricious weakness of violent nature. It is a magnificent short speech  and then this last hope is dispatched.The second great hope is also a trope: the Jewish doctor. His speech is well crafted as well. It runs against what we expect from the genre; no exposition. It also runs against what we expect from the WASPy Harvard guy. It is instead a meditation on perception  something which furthers the (at that point still undeveloped) special power of our hero.This thing falls apart in the ordinary challenge of wrapping up a story. You can tell where a weak last third was pasted on. Now the zombies become individuals again and the storyline stops countering the genre. This is tense in the traditional way and works  but is far from the skill level of the earlier decisions which placed us in a new place concerning our view.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.,negative

I've never read the source novel but do know it is structured as reportage where the world has been changed by a zombie infestation leading to a new geo-political shape for the world so in many ways this is more of a prequel than an adaptation . I did like Danny Boyle's genre shattering 28 DAYS LATER and loved the sequel and unfortunately it looks like that franchise has ended so in some ways this could be a surrogate 28 MONTHS LATER . Add to this the trailers where the waves of infected storm barriers against heavily armed soldiers and we've got a Zombie classic in the making don't we ?No we don't because this is a film that gives the impression that it was written and made by zombies From the outset we get something incomprehensible - the outbreak itself . WWZ keeps the origins of the virus an enigma and right away this damages the premise . At least in 28 DL the audience are afforded an opening scene of the rage virus escaping and you're very quickly able to buy in to this scenario . WWZ doesn't do this but an opening scene alludes to a virus breaking out across the world via news reports . Cut to scientist Brad Pitt driving his family in Philadelphia and finds himself in a traffic jam . Within seconds people run screaming from their cars as rabid zombies run everywhere This scene is mildly effective but there's a spanner in the works . Two spanners actually . One is that's very clear that the incubation period of this virus is a few seconds almost identical to that established in 28 DL . In reality such a violent virus would spread like wild fire but the thing is it wouldn't be able to cross continents which renders the later parts of the film as incomprehensible from a logic point of view . Secondly you will find it impossible to buy in to this scenario . I know I didn't but please feel free to ask questions As the film progresses Brad Pitt's scientist - and I won't call him by his character name because he doesn't have a character - jumps on a plane to South Korea then off to Israel where the Israelis have managed to block out the infected by building a massive big wall "" Wow that was quick Theo . The Israelis must be very good bricklayers to build a wall when the infection has only existed for a couple of days "" Oh no because the Mossad chief got word from India a few week earlier that the Indian army were fighting zombies . Before you ask it's never revealed why the news media never got hold of this potential headline   nor is it revealed why when the rest of the world is battling Zombies this unknown virus never got in to Israel The action scenes in Jerusalem are impressive from a spectacle point of view but again lack internal continuity . Safe behind their wall the Israelis let in refugees - while armies of Zombies swarm around outside . Narrowly escaping the carnage Brad stops to amputate the hand of a female IDF soldier whose just been bitten which defies credibility "" But Theo you know these Israelis are tough nuts and women have to endure pain and blood every month ""Not in the same league as amputation though is it ? Then Brad phones the UN who tell him that he must make his way to WHO research lab in Wales . Don't ask why there's no nearer research centres between Cardiff and Jerusalem . while on the aeroplane a Zombie that just happened to be hiding in the cupboard jumps out and spreads the infection leading to IDF girl to throw a grenade that causes the plane to crash in Wales . So they have a short walk to the WHO research centre "" Wouldn't blood loss caused by getting your hand amputated make you too weak to go for a short walk ? And wouldn't Britain being an island make quarantine against the virus much easier ? I mean if the Israelis managed it ? "" Look sit down and shut up . I know this was a major plot point that the rage virus couldn't escape from Britain in 28DL but if you think you can write a better Hollywood screenplay join the 7 billion people heading towards Hollywood right now . The last half hour involves more idiotic plotting that rely on coincidence   good fortune and after spending nearly every scene pointing out that the Zombies are attracted to noise someone just has to shoot a gun . The film ends with a solution to the problem which doesn't make the slightest bit of sense but means the human race can now concentrate on wiping out the Zombies "" But Theo won't the Zombies die of thirst ? "" I said shut up . If anything about this film made any sense it have been more than a loud dumb Summer blockbuster . You do notice that everything about it seems to have commercial consideration . Brad Pitt jumping all over the world meeting so many different nationalities does seem a cynical attempt at audience identification . Likewise the very obvious lack of blood and gore might supposedly attract people who fear the post apocalypse / Zombie genre ( Hello Bob The Moo ) but they'll notice the lack of intelligent plotting which severely damages the film and gore hounds who enjoy blood and guts will be disappointed by the extremely inoffensive nature of WWZ . Danny Boyle you're needed",positive

No one's better. Or more creative.,22-Sep-20,"Brad Pitt stars here as Gerry Lane  a former United Nations investigator who's pressed back into service when the whole world is over-run with zombies. Nobody knows exactly how this got started  but the results are devastating. A live person bitten by one of these things typically ""turns"" within a dozen seconds  although sometimes the process takes longer. After getting his family to supposed safety  Gerry goes globe trotting in search of answers and solutions.This loose  mega-budget adaptation of the novel by Max Brooks (son of comedy legend Mel Brooks!) doesn't lack for sheer spectacle. The filmmakers  led by director Marc Forster  try very hard to make sure you're not bored  with one over-the-top action set piece after another. They counteract these unintentionally amusing scenes with more human moments  as well as some suspense (such as the finale with Gerry avoiding the living dead while obtaining a possible solution in a World Health Organization building).You'll likely never see another movie with a higher count of zombie antagonists. They attack the living with true ferociousness  and in enormous numbers. Unfortunately  due to the expected plethora of CGI  a lot of these scenes often end up pretty funny to behold  rather than simply exciting. The story has its share of ridiculousness  with Gerry proving to have almost as many lives as a cat.The well-chosen international cast (Mireille Enos  Daniella Kertesz  James Badge Dale  Ludi Boeken  Fana Mokoena  Elyes Gabel  Peter Capaldi  Ruth Negga  etc.) provides excellent support  lending this material all the gravitas that they can muster. There's an especially vivid cameo for David Morse as an ex-CIA agent who's gone more than a little loopy. The character of Gerry is not fleshed out to any great degree  but Pitt makes for a decent hero nevertheless.Overall  the movie is watchable  without achieving its full potential. By this point in time  it does feel like stuff we've all seen before. Certainly it has some intriguing elements  and Forster & company waste little time getting started  creating intense moments of disaster within the first 10 minutes.Six out of 10.",positive

But here it is. Take it or leave it. If You take it  there is a lot of Sprawl and Globe Hopping  neither seen before in Zombie Movie Land. Gone is the Flesh Tearing and Muscle Munching  in its place there are Zillions of Zombies speeding and jumping around like Track Stars and numerous Aerial Shots that make them look more like Insects than the Living Dead.That's what you get and a lot of it. But there are problems Infecting this  that are quite Troublesome. Like building a Wall around Israel. You could read that as an Isolationist Political Statement separating the Israelis from the rest of the Middle East. Then there's the Biological Weapons thing. When Brad Pitt determines that some sort of Germ Inoculation is needed at the WHO  the Scientist there respond like a Clerk at Baskins Robbins  31 Flavors to go  We got your Sars  Ebola  Smallpox  and many more  take your pick. It is handled like these Caretakers and Makers of Biological Weapons are the Worlds Friend and Saviour. That is up for Debate.The Movie is Entertaining somewhat and the PG-13 Kids will most likely Eat it up. The Humongous Budget and Superstar Brad set this apart from others of its Ilk and that alone makes it a sorta Silly diversion from the usual Crunch and Munch Movies. Zombie Film Fans will most likely be Furious at the Gore-Down but others may find it Action Packed enough and give it a Pass.,positive

If you don't like zombie movies  then I still suggest watching it because this isn't your flesh or brain eating stomach turning variety. These walking undead are only out to spread their virus  hence their race  by biting their victims once if they can. It is clear that people are more like hosts for a sinister virus.The movie has a lot of tense moments and cool effects.

My top 5 favourites are Vertigo  North By Northwest  Rear Window  Rebecca and this masterpiece. Before I saw this  I considered Vertigo as his masterpiece. After seeing this movie  I think Psycho outshines Vertigo.Psycho is a film that you see once and never forget  and one of the few movies out there that has left me traumatised. The infamous shower scene is without doubt one of the most terrifying murder scenes in any film. When I first saw that scene on the 100 Greatest American Films  I was so terrified and I admit it I have never recovered. I had a similar experience watching the Disney film Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent enticing Aurora to the spinning wheel  and Mrs Gulch turning into the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz.The shower scene isn't the only effective or chilling scene in the film- in the events leading up to that scene I was biting my nails. The scene with the old woman in the chair also made me jump out of my skin. The whole of Psycho is terrifying  suspenseful and shocking. Two elements made this so. One was Hitchock's direction. The great director proves how truly great he is by directing Psycho in a masterful way  and manages to deliver the shocks when needed. The other is Bernard Hermann's music. What a creepy score! I loved his score for Vertigo and Miklos Rozsa's for Spellbound  but the high violin motif in the shower scene is the main reason why that scene in particular is so effective. I admit it  when I hear that motif  I start screaming. There is just something about it that makes your blood run cold.Other pros are a good plot  a well constructed screenplay and beautiful black and white cinematography that is perfect in conveying the creepy mood. And the ending did surprise me. The acting though was exemplary  with Janet Leigh giving one of the deservedly most memorable female performances in a Hitchcock movie  and Vera Miles also giving a stellar performance. Stealing the film is Antony Perkins as Norman Bates  he didn't just play creepy  he WAS creepy  his face  his voice  his mannerisms.. in short it is one of the most chilling performances of all time. All in all  a Hitchcock masterpiece! 10/10 Bethany Cox,positive

There was Mr. Perkins  the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans  etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.Tony Perkins was clearly ill at ease among the Sci-Fi crowd. People like the Star Trek cast members know what to expect at these gatherings and act accordingly. Perkins did not really know how to handle the banter  he was in my estimation a serious guy who must have thought he was in a freak show. I asked him about appearing in Friendly Persuasion with Gary Cooper and I told him that that was my favorite role he did. He looked grateful that someone knew he did something besides Norman Bates.But for better or worse  Norman Bates became his career role and it's what we remember Anthony Perkins for. He does create an indelible impression on the screen with Alfred Hitchcock's direction as the shy mother fixated man running a flea bag motel in an area where a new super highway has taken all the potential business.Psycho has a simple plot. Janet Leigh on an impulse embezzles $40 000 in cash from her employer and goes on the run. She winds up in the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother. Later on private detective Martin Balsam goes after her as well. And finally John Gavin as Leigh's boy friend and Vera Miles as her sister go looking for the both of them. Simple enough  but Alfred Hitchcock creates a mood of terror and suspense that lingers long after you've seen the film. My favorite shot of the film is not Leigh's legendary shower stabbing  but of Martin Balsam being knocked down and falling down that flight of stairs and then being stabbed to death. The camera work showing Balsam falling backwards is the most terrifying part of Psycho.Though Anthony Perkins did so many other good things  the average cinema fan will tell you 99 out of 100 times that Norman Bates is the role he remembers Perkins for. So Perkins went with the flow.It was repetitious for him  but a treat for fans.,positive

It's perfectly made  with an excellent story (thanks to the reliable schlockmeister Robert Bloch)  a great script adaptation  and assured direction from Hitchcock.It's hard to know what stands out here the most: the brooding cinematography  in which features such as the Bates Motel become characters in their own right  or Anthony Perkins's most famous role. Perkins encapsulates Bates perfectly  making him a bogeyman far more frightening than the OTT fantasy creations of a Freddy Krueger or Jason Vorhees.Watching it today  it's tough to imagine sitting through it without knowing the various twists beforehand  but they must have been mind-blowing to newcomers. And one of the things I like best is that the film is already great  and thrilling  even before the action shifts to the Bates Motel. Add in a great Martin Balsam performance and you have one of the greatest masterworks of 20th century cinema  in my humble opinion.,positive

If you don't already know what this movie is about then you really need to stop reading this right now and go watch the movie. I've seen this movie dozens of times over the years from VHS to DVD to Blu- ray and I've seen it at least five times on the big screen and for my money this is Alfredy Hitchcock's greatest film and one of the greatest ever made. I know VERTIGO  a brilliant movie  gets all the love and respect but for my money this here is his greatest film.Where do you start with a movie like this? Everyone knows that the budget was slashed on the director and it certainly helped the film because had this been in color or had it been lavished with a big budget then it just wouldn't have the same feel. The movie has some of the most historic moments in film history that everyone knows about. These moments are of course the shower sequence as well as the ending. Both certainly deserve to be mentioned whenever you discuss brilliant scenes but for my money the greatest sequence in the movie is what happens before the shower sequence and it's the discussion between Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) as they discuss what is basically holding them back.The performances between the two actors are just so flawless and this scene is so important because it tells us everything we need to know going into the second half of the movie  which is pretty much after the shower scene. The first portion of the movie we're worried and caring about the Crane character but we get the shock of what happens and then our sympathy immediately turns to Norman and him helping his mother. The way Hitchcock pulls this off is rather remarkable but the shocks keep happening with one terrific twist after another leading up to the ending.What's always amazed me about this movie is how your initial viewing is nothing but pure shocks and gasps but then on repeat viewings  even when you know all the secrets  you can enjoy it just as much because you can then enjoy the film by watching a master handle the material. You can watch for the clues and see all the winks that Hitchcock is giving the viewer. No matter how many times I watch this film I can simply sit back and enjoy it on so many levels. It's a movie where you brain knows what's going on but the film is just so great that you can enjoy everything and wish that the character's fate changes somehow.Everything from the performances to the score to the cinematography are flawless. This is without question one of the most impressive movies ever made. It's certainly a ground-breaking picture that has its legendary director at the top of his game. PSYCHO has been copied countless times over the past fifty-five years but nothing has come close to its impact.,positive

In a stormy night  she stops at the isolated Bates Motel where she meets creepy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).This one has Alfred Hitchcock as the master salesman. It's the biggest show in show business  and he's the master of ceremony. He pulls out all the stops like the secrecy and the refusal of entry to late arrivals. It helps to have the most iconic movie scene of all times.Janet Leigh isn't just a damsel in distress or a shrinking violet. She is a woman with a dark side. The fact that she's an A-list star used to mean that she'll last until the end of the movie. When the super creepy Anthony Perkins joins her  it was set up for a prolong creepfest. Then comes the most well made important scene in history. The second half does have a little struggle to reclimb that peak  and I didn't like all the pontificating at the end. But those are tiny problems in a great movie.,positive

We don't need to see knives tearing into flesh  people being strangled on the screen  or gunshots ripping through a brain. And still  when we are finished  we are more uncomfortable than had we watched the actual murder. In Psycho  it's all about vulnerability. Janet Leigh is in a state of great agitation and needs to trust someone. Unfortunately it is the master taxidermist  Anthony Perkins. His Norman Bates  with his nervous tics  his analytical surmises  his understatement  are master-pieces of madness. This film is what every student should see. It is montage; it is tautness; it is the best kind of storytelling. The things which were still with me a month after seeing this for the first time were as follows:1. The house. That ominous house  peering down  Poe-like from the hill above the motel. How can architecture better capture threat.2. The scene with the patrolman.3. The conversation Norman when Marion first stops at the motel.4. The shower scene. I can still hear the theramin (used again at the end)  and the blood flowing down the shower drain.5. The killing of Martin Balsam on the stairs (he also used this perspective in Vertigo and Topaz).6. The ""conversations"" with Mother.7. The naked light bulb swinging as the rocker turns around and Norman coming into the basement.What a great director. He saw everything and knew how to fill every minute with suspense.

I haven't seen the shot-by-shot remake that came out  10 years or so ago  but if you watch one Psycho  it should be this one. Actually if you watch more than one Psycho  it would be good if you'd watch the other Psychos (Psycho 2  3 and so forth). Although they are with Anthony Perkins  I'm pretty sure they are not as good as this one though.A very eerie performance by Mr. Perkins then  with a very interesting idea (that hopefully comes as a surprise when you watch it  because it would be a shame if someone did spoil you the movie  by telling you what will happen). Quite a few things get done here and other directors have taken those ideas and used them time and again. It's a testament to Hitchcocks genius  how good his movie works and still how much tension is in it  because it hasn't aged a bit.A great movie  by a great director. I watched it recently at a cinema  but I have to admit  that I missed the small cameo Hitchcock has in his movies. That's saying something about how gripping the movie was for me. And since I hadn't seen it for quite some time  I really discovered quite a few things  by watching it. So even if you have seen it  you can watch it again and again!,positive

Sure Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) seems highly erratic when questioned by the patrolman  but hardly psychotic. It's not until director Hitchcock suddenly pulls the rug out from under the forty thousand dollar robbery setup  and Marion falls victim to the frenzy of a slashing knife accompanied by the now historic soundtrack that's been indelibly identified with ""Psycho""  that we get the idea that this is not your standard mystery.This is a classic and historic movie  the first on many levels to create a new kind of horror film. Hitchcock was a master of thrills and suspense without ever relying on violence. Here he allows a slight departure from that formula  but without overemphasizing the gore. When the naked Marion Crane is attacked in a shower  completely helpless  it was the birth of a new genre  which unfortunately has degraded into the sensationalist slasher schlock of present day. In ""Psycho""  you never see it coming  except for that shadowed figure behind the shower curtain  but by then it's too late to gasp  you're caught up in the on screen event  and it leaves you breathless.Some viewers call it a perfect film. I don't know if I would go that far  as I've thought about things I might have changed in telling the story. When Marion leaves the used car lot under scrutiny of the highway patrolman  it makes you wonder why he didn't follow up his instinct that there was something fishy going on. Then at the end of the film  the way the psychologist explained in detail the nature of Norman Bates' psychosis  made it seem like it wasn't enough to let the viewer arrive at a conclusion for oneself. But those nitpicks aside  one has to give credit to the principals for pulling off a great psychological and horror thriller. Anthony Perkins couldn't have been smoother  and it's not until at least a second viewing that you realize how wonderful a set up you have to the film's dire outcome.

For starters  when Marion and Norman first meet  you can see Norman's reflection in the window  as if there's two of him. When Marion and Norman are eating dinner in the room with the stuffed birds  you can see that some of the birds are positioned so that their beaks look almost as if they're pecking at both Marion and Norman; something is eating at Norman  and we get to see a premonition of Marion's impending fate. When Norman looks through the hole (which incidentally is behind a picture of two people attacking a woman)  we get a POV shot; when Marion is in the shower  we get a POV shot. When Norman pushes Marion's car into the swamp  half of his face is in a shadow  as if he has two sides.On the subject of those birds  there are several references to birds throughout the movie: Marion's last name is Crane  she comes from Phoenix  and finally  the stuffed birds. The truth is  Hitchcock had a keen interest in avians; in ""Sabotage""  a woman finds her strength after watching ""Who Killed Cock Robin?""  then the bird references in ""Psycho""  and finally  the ornithological uprising in ""The Birds"". Speaking of the characters' names  there's Crane (a bird)  Bates (bait)  Loomis (gloom)  and Arbogast (aghast).Another thing that Hitch does in this movie is play with the audience. First  the movie focuses on Marion. When she steals the money  you're not sure whether to root for her  because she is the main character and you want her to succeed  but do you want her to steal? Then  the movie focuses on Norman. When he hides Marion's murder  you want him to succeed  but succeed in hiding a murder? Finally  the focus shifts to Lila.Everyone remembers the shower scene  but what does it mean? It seems as though Marion  by flushing the paper down the toilet  was washing away her misdeeds  and taking a shower consecrated that.The dialogue is of course a key part. Obviously  ""Mother...what's the phrase...isn't quite herself today."" and ""A boy's best friend is his mother."" are premonitions  but there are others. In the discussion of institutions  Norman talks about ""...the cruel eyes studying you."" Then  when he looks through the hole  his eyes study Marion. At the end  you might say that there are three explanations: first  the bombastic psychiatrist explains Norman's mental state; then  ""mother"" describes how her son is guilty; and finally  the car is towed out of the swamp  as though they have dug into the putridity of Norman's mind. They have penetrated Norman's mind  just like the knives penetrated Marion's and Arbogast's bodies.On the DVD  you should watch the original trailer  which has Hitch showing us around the motel and house. He was really playing with the audience there. First off  he looked into a toilet. No movie had ever portrayed a toilet (but everyone knew why toilets existed)  so what must the audience have thought about that? Also  he looks in a closet  looks surprised  and closes the closet. Did he see something in there? I try to imagine being someone who saw that trailer  and then saw the movie  waiting to see what would happen.",positive

But along the way she stops at the Bates Motel  and meets the charming Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Marion and her money might not make it back to her boyfriend Sam in perfect condition.Yes  after 47 years of this film existing and being a horror fan for well over 10 years now  I finally broke down and watched what is widely considered to be Hitchcock's best film (I had previously seen ""Lamb to Slaughter""  ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"" -- and have now seen many more since). Boy  was I missing out on something! Now I cannot wait to see ""Psycho 2"" and ""Psycho 3"" (which I own for some reason). I have seen parts of the Gus Van Sant remake but was not impressed.The acting was very good  especially from Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates). He did a great job as a friendly boy-next-door caretaker. Vivian Leigh was also good as Marion Crane  and I am sorry she had to have a hermaphroditic child like Jamie Lee Curtis. All other parts were fine. I hear they called the actor who played Sam Loomis ""the stiff"" and boy are they right! Later in the film he loosens up a little bit  but in the opening scene he seems so wooden.The bird symbolism is nice... especially with Hitchcock's other big horror film being ""The Birds"". And the main character being Marion ""Crane""? Is she going to get stuffed like the other birds in the parlor? I will not say  but you probably already know (since pretty much everyone knows about this film even if they never saw it).Most startling for me was Bernard Herrmann's score  particularly the main theme (not the knife noise). I had long heard rumors that ""Re-Animator"" ripped off the ""Psycho"" theme and I thought they meant it was a variation on the theme. An homage  perhaps (because who would try to steal from such a famous film). Well  the music is exactly the same. I mean  really dead on. So now I do not know how to feel about ""Re-Animator""  which is practically my favorite horror film (with all due respect to ""The Janitor"")... which shakes up my whole foundation and makes me rethink movie history! My only complaint was the confusion (at least for me) of where the Bates Motel is. Marion drives all Friday night and then arrives Saturday evening  implying it is a great distance from Phoenix. Yet  when the detective investigates the motel  he tells someone on the phone he is less than an hour from them. Where is he based if not Phoenix?Well  if you have not seen this  you should. It is a classic and with good reason (as I typed this the first time  it was ranked the 22nd greatest film of all time on Internet Movie Database and still lingers around 25th three years later). Not just a great horror classic  but also a great film with great directing and cast. Plus  if you are from Wisconsin like I am  you'll love the Ed Gein storyline. (Incidentally  if you have never visited Ed Gein's hometown or grave  you should. It is a good time.)",positive

On her journey she finds the Bates Motel and decides to stop there for the night. She then meets a great villain played by Anthony Perkins  Norman Bates. As she gets to know him she finds he is quite terrifying while talking. He mentions his mother and says ""She just goes mad sometimes. We all go a little mad sometimes!"" Anyway  later she takes a shower  and everyone remembers seeing the stabbing of her  and the star is dead. The film continues this psychopathic story by having first Det. Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam)  who is murdered  and then her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) come and look for her. Hitchcock has done a superb job in creating suspense and horror  I especially loved the dead mother in the chair  and the great score by Bernard Herrmann  particularly the famous high screeches of the violins (like knives stabbing).

Rather than going to the bank she sets off to California. It is a long journey and after spending one night in her car  after she is woken by a suspicious police officer she buys a new car. Then  as it starts to rain  she leaves the main road and stops at a remote motel for the night. The motel is run by Norman Bates who tells her that he lives in the neighbouring house with his aged mother. He appears to be friendly as he offers to make her something for supper. She hears his mother expressing her disapproval of him being alone with a young woman before she has her supper in the office. The then returns to her room and prepares for bed. Now things get creepy; Norman takes a picture off the wall and uses a spy hole to observe Marion as she gets undressed. Then as she takes a shower somebody enters her room and brutally murders her. Soon people are starting to wonder what happened to her and the $40 000. Her boss has sent a private detective to find her and her sister goes to see her boyfriend  who has no idea where she is. The detective checks a string of motels before finding that she stayed at the Bates motel. As the story progresses we learn more about Norman and his mother all leading to one of cinema's most shocking conclusions.This film is rightly considered a classic; I would love to have watched it without knowing about what happened. For the first half of the film follows Marion Crane  setting her up as the protagonist; everybody else we see  including Norman Bates  appears to be very much secondary characters so anybody lucky enough not to know the film's first famous twist should be genuinely surprised. Until her death it looks as though the film would centre on whether she would be caught or whether she would see the error of her ways and return the money. After the infamous 'shower scene' the tone changes dramatically as we learn just what is going on at the Bates Motel and ultimately discover Norman's shocking secret. Janet Leigh does a fine job as the good girl who has made a bad choice but it is Anthony Perkins who stands out with his nuanced performance as Norman Bates; at times charming at others chilling. Hitchcock's direction is superb; he manages to show brutal murder without actually showing and of the actual brutality; just a raised knife  Marion screaming and blood going down the plug hole blood that isn't even red as the film is black and white. Obviously this isn't suitable for younger viewers but I'd say it is a must see for all older film fans.,positive

Many mysteries  possibly most  have surprises waiting at the end but they rarely leave you dumbfounded. ""The Crying Game"" is one of the exceptions  however  and ""Psycho"" is the mother of them all.There isn't much point in going through the plot again  so I'll just note a few impressions that have lasted over many viewings.One is that there are a couple of usually ignored people in the crew that deserve medals. One is the production designer  who is responsible for the overall look of the picture. His work could hardly be improved upon  from the oppressively bleak landscape surrounding Janet Leigh's car when the CHP officer wakes her up  to the haunted mansion on top of the slight hill  surrounded by gardens of weeds.The other neglected contributor is the set dresser. Of course the director  the punctilious Hitchcock  decides questions of props and camera placement  but -- that soulless and bourgeois real estate office with its potted plants and its large picture of a sere landscape that perches over Janet Leigh's desk; the stuffed birds suggestive of Poe (a raven) or a menacing nocturnal predator (an owl)  and the pictures of birds  juxtaposed with pictures of roly poly naked nymphs  some in the act of being violated. In Bloch's novel and in the film  the untitled book that Vera Miles examines in Perkins' little-boy bedroom is filled with pornography but it couldn't be shown on screen.The murder in the shower doesn't need to be described but I've never been able to watch this without a sinking feeling that Janet Leigh really doesn't NEED that shower at this particular point in time and space. Leigh is a fine actress. When she's driving away from Phoenix and the camera is on her face  minuscule expressions come and go across her features  reflecting the conversations she's fantasizing about. There's even a hint of a wry smile when she imagines the outrage of Cassady  the fat and self-satisfied millionaire  when he discovers that Leigh has absconded with the money he flaunted  as in -- ""Take that  you bastard."" There's something aptly birdlike about Janet Leigh too. She's narrow shouldered and long legged  a little stork-like  as well as being just the right age. She has the desperation of a woman facing forty. Of course to a man who's spent the last ten years alone with a corpse  Leigh is an object of Paphian interest. She's old but not too old yet  just as she's a star but not too big a star to torpedo the movie when she is eliminated from it.Two shots stand out from a multitude of originals. (1) When Balsam finds Leigh's fake signature in the motel's register  the camera is looking up at Tony Perkins  who is nibbling some candy. Balsam says  ""Oh  yes. Here she is "" and invites Perkins to examine the fake. The camera doesn't cut away but remains on Perkins' jaw as he leans over the unseen book and we watch his jaw and adam's apple working nervously away. (2) Perkins decides to move Mama from her bedroom to the fruit cellar. The camera follows him very slowly as he climbs the stairs and enters her room  but inside of going through the door  the camera rises about the transom and pivots around  an extraordinary movement  so that when Perkins exits lugging mother in his arms  we are too flabbergasted by what the camera has done to notice any discrepancy between the reality Norman has constructed for us and any reality that most of the rest of us might recognize.(3) Just to be wanton  I'll throw in that shot of Janet Leigh's dead eye. The camera first follows a pale stream of blood down INTO the bathtub drain  then dissolves to Leigh's staring iris  then draws back along the floor while deliberately righting itself from a slight tilt to the proper vertical. (Check out the remake. The camera apes the original shot but practically twirls on its axis.) Two weakness or  let's say  things I wish Hitchcock would have done a little differently. One is that car gurgling and sinking into that accommodating swamp. You only find those swamps in the movies and Louisiana. The second is that experimental scene in which Martin Balsam tumbles backward down a rear-projected staircase. The director was more proud of the mechanical difficulties behind that shot than he had a right to be.You know what occurs to me sometimes  when I'm watching this  or when I'm watching some of the garbage that now fills our screens? I wish that the people writing and directing movies like ""Saw II"" would rescreen ""Psycho"" so they could get some hint about how to make a truly horrifying movie with practically no blood  no monsters with chain saws and no teen agers screaming and running round in panties. Man  have we lost our grip  or what? And while we're at it let's have no more girls named Jillian or Megan  either. I'm tired of them. Bring back the old days when movies had little blood and girls had sensible names like Mary and Hepzibah. Oh -- and let's get rid of that hand-held electronic junk too. No more iPods or Pseudopods or whatever they are. No Blackberries or Strawberries either. Whatever happened to whitewall tires?",positive

Of course  I was young and more impressionable so I guess I just remembered those few dramatic  sensational scenes such as Janet Leigh murdered in the shower and the quick other murder at the top of the stairs. Basically  that was about it  action-wise  BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film  the more I like it. It has become my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie  along with Rear Window.I mention the lack of action  and blood  too  because younger people who might be watching this for the first time are not going to see the kind of horror film they're accustomed to seeing. A generation back  movie makers tended to build up characters and suspense  so there was a lot more storytelling and less action than you see today. Also  this movie doesn't have the shock value today for audiences  either  not after years of Freddie Krueger-type blood-and-guts seen in the past 30 years.But  what you WILL see in this movie is (1) superb acting; (2) a fascinating lead character; (3) excellent photography  and (4) a bizarre story.""Norman Bates"" is one of the most famous fictional names in film history  thanks to this film and the great work portraying him by Anthony Perkins. ""Norman"" is a nutcase  as it turns out and the more you know all about him  the more fun it is to study Perkins and his character ""Norman"" in subsequent viewings. He really has the guy down pat. However  it isn't just Perkins' film; the supporting is just fine with Leigh  whose figure is still awesome no matter how many times you see it; Martin Balsam as the private detective; Vera Miles and John Gavin. Everyone contributes.What makes me really enjoy this movie is the cinematography. I bought this on VHS when it became available on widescreen. Later  of course  I got the DVD. Each time  I appreciate John Russell's camera-work and Hitchcock's direction more and more. I wonder if this isn't Hitchcock's best job of directing as his camera angles and lighting are outstanding. On the DVD  the blacks  whites and grays are just super and the famous house next to the Bates Motel never looked better. That house really looks eerie.The sound effects in here don't hurt. When Balsam is attacked  the accompanying frightening music never fails to bring chills down my spine. The music literally ""screams"" at you.I went 35 years between showings but now have watched this five times in the past four years. I love it and look forward to seeing it again. Many people here think this is Hitchcock's greatest film. Add me to that list.",positive

Janet Leigh is bank employee Marion Crane  who has let temptation get the better of her and absconded with $40 000. Feeling tired after a long trip on the road to visit her lover Sam Loomis (John Gavin)  Marion decides to check into the Bates establishment  where she meets a sticky end whilst taking a shower (c'mon  don't tell me you didn't know...).When Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) travels to Fairvale to see if Sam knows anything of her sister's whereabouts  she is tailed by private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam)  whose expertise eventually leads him to the Bates motel where Norman and 'mother' wait with butcher's knife in hand.Working from a script by Joseph Stefano (based on the novel by Robert Bloch)  Hitchcock delivers a flawless exercise in horror that sees the director develop techniques so effective that they are still imitated to this day  but which are rarely as well executed as they are here. Hitchcock's finest achievement with Psycho is undoubtedly fooling his audience into assuming that Leigh is the central character and then suddenly bumping her off  metaphorically pulling the rug from under the viewers feet; but he also manages many other brilliant touches  including Marion Crane's tense flight from Phoenix  where she imagines how events are unfolding at the bank  Norman's disposal of Ms Crane's car in a swamp (with her body in the boot)  a moment of wonderful dark humour as the vehicle momentarily refuses to sink  and of course  the macabre ending in which Lila discovers Norman's mother hiding in the fruit cellar.Add a cool title sequence by Saul Bass and a fantastic score by Bernard Hermann  itself often imitated  and what you have is a bona fide classic of the horror genre (yes  horror) that any self respecting fan should ensure that they see at least several times. It's that good.,positive

This relatively low-budget film is in silvery black-and-white  eerie and beautiful  with gliding camera-work and clever production touches which warrant repeat viewings  however it is much too merciless towards its characters to be a black comedy. It's also not much of a murder-mystery (we have an early idea of what's going on)  yet the suspense in the third act is mounted with cunning precision. Mostly  Hitchcock seems curiously fascinated with plot-exposition and details  although the picture is still quite chilling. Anthony Perkins' tightly-controlled performance as Norman Bates is hypnotizing: his boyish good looks can be taken either way--gangly or crazily disconnected--and his eyes  which are frantic  dart around like an impatient child's (it's the role of a lifetime). I didn't much care for Simon Oakland's psychology report at the end  but the final shots and the voice-over are masterfully pulled-off. *** from ****",negative

That's the main-line  given stroke of it. But what it comes down to is that  really  seriously... it's Psycho - the one and only (that we acknowledge  screw off  Gus Van Sant). More than anything why it's Hitchcock's triumph as a commercial filmmaker - past the shower scene and the camera tricks and the notorious finale - is that it's (not so) secretly a monument to what we hide in all of us.What I love about the movie seeing it again after so many years is seeing how in her own way Marion Crane is a bit of a psycho  just not quite at the level of 11 that Norman Bates is. There's an interesting parallel to make to how voice-over is used; Marion's imagination gets the better of her for a moment as she drives along and she makes up what the cop that pulls her over  her boss  her boyfriend  etc  all say. Watch as her face contorts into a little grin  almost against her better judgment  when she imagines the more twisted portion of the dialog. Frankly  I've had dialogs going in my head like that  imagining the worst that could happen from a mistake or bad deed  and almost taking pleasure in the more morbid aspects (I mean  hey  I directed Jealous Jerzy  what does that tell you? But I digress).So keep that in mind when it comes time for the end of the movie - hell any portion really with Norman and ""Mother"". But mostly that last scene. After what is an amusing parody of exposition (the psychologist goes on for so long that it's the only logical explanation aside from dated  clunky writing - I prefer to think Hitchcock was smarter than that and was mocking what would or could be an exposition on Norman Bates + Mother and then just ""Mother"")  Norman/Mother is in his/her room  and the camera closes in as the voice-over gets intense  plotting  paranoid  not wanting to swat a fly. Perhaps Hitchcock wants to draw the parallel  though there is a distinction: Marion imagines other people talking  while Norman isn't even in the equation: it IS Mother. Yeah.Such great stuff. And if you haven't seen it before... what are you reading this for ya dummy!",positive

I have very few to add to that  except for the fact that I couldn't agree more with this status. I'm not a giant fan of Alfred Hitchcock but I do find that he deserves his title ""master of suspense"". If it were only for this movie alone. Psycho is the most important modern horror movie since it gave a whole new image to the character of the ""serial killer"". Norman Bates is frightening but there's always sympathy for him. He's the most influential horror icon without a doubt. I doubt that there're many people who don't now about the terrific climax by now. I've heard spoilers about this movie before I knew it even existed...But still  there are always surprises to discover and no matter how many times you see it you'll always be impressed. Other than that  there isn't much to say about this milestone in cinema. Watch this movie if you haven't yet and don't go on calling yourself a cinema fan before you see it !! But  avoid the 1998 remake at all costs! Although there are a few decent actors in that ( William H.Macy  Julliane Moore and Viggo Mortensen ) it's a disgrace to Alfred Hitchcock and to everyone else who was involved with the original version",positive

That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance  the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit  casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side  a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting  bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly  Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time  never showing them in the same frame  thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation.Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this  a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him  but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating  namely his hobby  taxidermy. That is  how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially  an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete  Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic  namely how to fill one's time  is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time  however  he tries to casually laugh it off  one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave  that is  go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things  but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something  as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escape—how we ""scratch and claw"" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion  this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman  it's a disclosure of how he views his own life  and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. At this point  Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother  Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away  like ""in an institution or something"". This triggers a sudden  hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death  as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms  he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems  at least Mom's ""harmless"". Then in another note of supreme irony  he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go ""a little mad sometimes"". This of course would include Marion by inference  who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time  Norman reverts to his usual affable façade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion  she may have resolved one trap  but has now entered a far more deadly one.This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic  but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are  it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise  we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman  but can't be sure exactly what  while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment  he's all boyish charm  the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. Of course  Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene  her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings  an essentially secondary role  but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt  this was an actress with more than just a pretty face.To me  Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy  ditto the picture itself  along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course  it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time  a big part of the classic flick  in my book  at least  rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror  so brilliantly understated.",positive

But it's still very good.,8-May-07,This was a very good film  but like many recent films  its score has been inflated on IMDb thanks to young viewers that have no appreciation for anything made before they were born--hence older deserving films often are rated lower even though they are excellent films. As a result  lots of mediocre or above average films are given astronomical scores (a great case in point  the film MEMENTO). Now this ISN'T to say that SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a bad film--it's very good  but it isn't so good that I would rank it in the IMDb Top 250! In fact  it's a darn clever film that manages to inject life into a dull genre (zombie movies--when you've seen one  you think you've seen them all). In particular  it's tongue-in-cheek sense of humor was quite refreshing and the film had one of the best endings I have ever seen--I was laughing about the shed scene for weeks. Excellent  refreshing and clever--just NOT Top 250 material.,positive

But no...I loved it. Some parts do drag  especially the beginning which took a little too long to get going  but I loved the film's deadpan and offbeat style and effortless mix of undergraduate humour and hardcore horror. If you love blood and gore  you have found your match with Shaun of the Dead  and if you love offbeat and sophisticated humour delivered in a deadpan way you have also met your match. The cinematography is innovative and unique  the music just adds to the atmosphere  the screenplay is extraordinarily clever and hilarious and the story is original and well constructed. Another strong asset is the cast  Simon Pegg is just wonderful  and Nick Frost is hilarious. Then we have great actors like Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy who are terrific as Barbara and Phillip. Overall  just a great film  although it is a one-joke concept it actually works. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

A great caste  a cracking  laugh-a-minute script and a distinctively British twist on the old-fashioned zombie proceedings make this one to watch. It works brilliantly as a comedy  with tons of laughs (the dart in the head scene is still my favourite) and plenty of witty repartee. As a zombie film  it's also cool  what with social referencing  sometimes astonishing scenes of gore (we've got people being impaled  beaten  and in one outstanding moment  Dylan Moran getting his guts torn out and his legs torn off) and loads and loads of suspense and action. I've never seen anything quite like it.Simon Pegg is the star and his crew from SPACED do most of the work behind the scenes. Pegg  who I'd never watched before  is great  with his typical everyday looks and impeccable timing. His brutish friend Ed  as played by the strangely familiar Nick Frost  steals every moment he's on screen  proving to be the better than Johnny Vegas. The supporting cast  of seemingly every British TV comedian in existence  is also fine   with Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy as Pegg's parents particularly good. The film is chock-full of references; even the pre-credits production titles have the music from DAWN OF THE DEAD on them! There are plenty more scenes that you'll miss but that repeat viewing will show. The reason the film is so successful is because of the originality. Okay  so the overall plot is familiar  but the individual jokes  humour  and physicality of it pay off in dividends. The ending is a little too dark in places but nevertheless the film's winning streak of black comedy makes it worthwhile. Okay  so I still don't know if dogs can look up  but watching this film is a fine and fun experience.,positive

He hangs out with his slobbish friend and spends every evening in the Winchester pub.  Fed up with this  his girlfriend dumps him  leaving him with the words of his other flatmate ringing in his ears - `sort your life out'.  His plans take an unexpected turn when he and Ed eventually notice that London's populace has mostly given into a virus that turns them into  well  the Z word.  Shaun and Ed devise a plan to keep safe and rescue Shaun's mother and ex.Although the makers were cursing themselves for the unfortunate timing of this film's release with the (much bigger budget) remake of Dawn of the Dead - however for me this served as a rather nice experience after the straight-scares of Dawn.  A point to note for all those moaners  is that this film went into production before the remake did.  Anyway  ignoring this issue it is important to note that the film is a very British affair and is aimed at a very particular sense of humour.  In essence  if you love Spaced then you'll enjoy this.  The film is NOT a spoof - it is a horror movie with laughs  not unlike Evil Dead in that regard.  The gags are good but not as fast as Spaced fans will be used to - instead they are put in with the horror rather than being forced over the top of it.The film has movie references  but not to the point where they become the gags themselves (Spaced's cutaways for example).  In place of that we have references to Deer Hunter and The Matrix that are funny but will not spoil things for you if you don't spot them.  I laughed throughout but it is important not to expect to be rolling in the aisles - the film is still a horror  not a Naked Gun style spoof.As a horror  the film is not really scary but does have a good gutful of gore to go around.  The zombies are slow  and this will not work for modern audiences  but it does hark back to the old zombie flicks and also allows the material to work.  I closed my eyes a few times as the film provided blood  and it does have the odd moment that is touching.  Of course the laughs are everything and  aside from a slow start and a more horror-focused ending  this is consistently funny.The one thing that it also does well is have a slight satirical edge to it. It is delivered rather heavily (early scenes of hooded youths lumbering around force the point home too heavily) but it is still true - having done my shopping in Asda just before seeing this film I can definitely contest that many of us lumber around in a semi-trance!  This is a nice touch - the Dawn remake lacked any of the comment that it's original made  so it is good to have some here.  Again however  non-Brits may not totally pick up on this as we seem to be one of the few countries that has this pub-orientated culture.The cast are great and will be full of faces recognisable from the TV series that this film will draw the majority of it's fans from.  Pegg is great  he is a slightly more advanced version of his Spaced character and he makes for a good leading character simply because he is so recognisable - this is not a Hollywood film with characters we don't know  but instead a bloke from a pub.  Despite the fact that I would hate Ed in real life  Frost is hilariously exaggerated.  He looks very different from Spaced but he does well with the material.  Ashfield is spunky and the only downside to her is that she would never be with Shaun in the first place.  Support is good from Moran  Davis and Nighy.  There are plenty of in-jokes for fans  including a great cameo from Stevenson  who also shows up with her own group of friends that mirror Shaun's friends in terms of looks and (pretty much) TV series background (eg Tim from the Office and Fran from Black Books).Overall this will not please everyone and I fear that some will not laugh as much as the adverts and hype suggested.  However it is a good horror comedy and easily the best British film of the year so far - fans of Spaced will notice the joke rate is scaled back but it is still very funny.  The humour of Spaced has reached the big screen and is doing good things for the British cinema industry.  The makers said they threw so much into the film (horror  comedy  romance  drama  gore) because they didn't think they would be allowed to make another film - I hope to god that is not the case.,positive

I have to admit that I've never heard of ""Spaced"". But even so  this movie is still really great. More than just a zombie movie - or even just a spoof - it's sort of a look at how various factors in our lives make us zombie-like. Everything has a very English feel to it  and the zombies themselves are almost hypnotic. I'd never heard of Simon Pegg before seeing ""SOTD""  but I can certainly say that he does a hilarious job as the out-and-out Brit having to battle the living dead. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Penelope Wilton (Kevin Kline's wife in ""Cry Freedom"") and Bill Nighy.",positive

We follow Shaun  who fights to win his girlfriend Liz back... fights zombies  that is.The humor is distinctly British  and some of the humor relies on a familiarity with the show ""Spaced""  which is probably not well known to the general audience. Much of the jokes are also obscure references to other horror films. But most of the humor is universal  as we all probably know what it is like to have a bad day  have a bad job  and have things go wrong with a great woman (or man  as the case may be). And all too many of us know what it is like to live with a deadbeat roommate.The zombie effects are pretty decent  though not as gory as in many films. The humor outweighs the scary obviously. The scenery is great  and many of the scenes are so derivative of ""Dawn of the Dead"" that it is hard not to like this film. (Some scenes  some music and even some dialog is lifted directly from Romero... such as news broadcasts and the classic ""We're coming to get you  Barbara."") I enjoyed the multiple times a character was told not to call the zombies ""zombies""... because it calls to mind the great difference between horror movie characters and horror movie viewers. (Horror movie viewers know Romero made zombie films  but the word ""zombie"" is not used in those films... even the ""Dawn"" remake never once calls them ""zombies"".) I do not know if I would make this a must-see movie  but it is one of those films that everyone has seen  so you probably would not be a true horror fan unless you have seen it  too. And the way it went on to influence zombie films and zombie comedies over the next decade is incredible  culminating in the nearly-as-good ""Cockneys Vs. Zombies""  that any ""Shaun"" fan should be sure to see. Stephen King proclaimed it was ""destined to be a cult classic."" He was right.",positive

Shaun (Pegg) is just an ordinary bloke living with his mate Ed (Danger! 50 000 Volts! star Nick Frost) and also Pete (Comic Relief 2003's Terry Wogan  Peter Serafinowicz).

Here Simon Pegg plays the eponymous Shaun  a salesman in a dead end job who lives with his best mate Ed who just lazes around playing video games all day before spending the evenings down the pub with Shaun  Shaun's girlfriend Liz and her friends Dianne and David. His life is so mundane that he doesn't notice that the streets are slowly filling with the walking dead. When he finally does notice he decides that he and Ed must go and rescue his mother and his now ex-girlfriend and seek sanctuary in The Winchester. Things are complicated by the fact that his step father has been bitten and the area around the pub is crawling with the living dead! While this is primarily a comedy there should be enough gore to please horror fans; in fact I suspect they will enjoy the comedy more too as they will spot references that those not familiar with the classics of the zombie genre  like me  will miss. The story is pretty basic but that doesn't matter; extra subplots would just have been a distraction. The acting was pretty solid; Simon Pegg was ideal as Shaun and Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy were great as his mother and step father; both providing some surprisingly emotional scenes for a film of this type. There is a fair amount of gore; once or twice things get extremely gory however it isn't really dwelt on too much. Fans of 'Spaced' will be pleased to see Jessica Hynes even though her role is much smaller here. If you are in the mood for a horror film but also want a good laugh then this could be just the film you are looking for.,positive

Our hero (Simon Pegg)  a shiftless bum who has just lost his girlfriend due to his ineptness  winds up being the productive guy who saves the day and gets his girl back. Along the way  we get a number of laughs and a number of gross-out horror scenes  and a lot of f- words and the like. Nick Frost  as Simon''s best friend  provides the best and most disgusting of the low-life characters  which are unfamiliar over here.This is dark humor  to say the least  and would would appeal more to younger people although I like dark humor and I'm an old fart....but others over 50  beware.

Whilst I still believe that the ending loses it's way a little (with much of the comedy being ditched in favour of gore  action and attempts at emotional drama)  as horror comedies go  this is definitely one of the best.The deadpan and often surreal humour certainly won't be to everyone's taste  but those who enjoyed director Edgar Wright's TV series Spaced and who have watched an unhealthily disproportionate amount of zombie films will be guaranteed a good time  as Pegg and friends lampoon the 'dead' films of George Romero with an obvious and genuine affection for the genre.Best moment: when Nick Frost shouts 'We're coming to get you  Barbara'.

Now  the intervening years may have diminished my zombie adoration  but I still love this film. It takes what most of the cast had been doing on the BBC show Spaced (particularly the ""Art"" episode) and truly takes it to the next level.Shaun works in an electronics store (named for Dawn of the Dead star Ken Foree) with a really bad life  to be honest. He has family issues  girlfriend issues  roommate issues  work issues - man  he has issues. When he wakes up to a zombie apocalypse  however  he finally finds purpose in life.The storyline is simple  but the film is anything but. I've always been struck by how much emotion this wrings out - Shaun finally connecting with his stepfather Phillip (the always great Bill Nighy) moments before he dies and comes back from the dead  the final talk between our hero and his mother  and how the ending keeps status quo while allowing Shaun to claim a new life alongside the woman he loves.No less of a zombie luminary than George Romero loved this movie. In fact  he invited Pegg and Wright to appear in 2005's Land of the Dead. However  the duo insisted on being zombies rather than the human roles they were offered.My favorite scene in the film is when Shaun and his friend (potentially ex-girlfriend) Yvonne and her friends as they're both on the run. Beyond their friends being mirror images of one another  they're also famous British couples: Simon Pegg and Jessica Hynes were Tim and Daisy from Spaced; Lucy Davis and Martin Freeman were Dawn and Tim from the British version of The Office; Dylan Moran and Tamsin Greig were Bernard and Fran from Black Books; Julia Deakin and Nick Frost were also in Spaced.There are a ton of zombie movie references here  like an Italian place named Fulci's; the Winchester bar having a Winchester model 66  the same gun from Night of the Living Dead; a restaurant named Bub's Pizza after Bub from Day of the Dead; an employee named Ash is mentioned in Shaun's speech in the beginning  referencing Evil Dead; the song on the bus is ""Kernkraft 400"" by Zombie Nation; plus there's debate as to what to call the zombies  as many modern films refer to them as infected instead of the actual word. And of course  Ed shouting ""We're coming to get you  Barbara!"" comes directly from the movie that this all comes from  Night of the Living Dead.Even though this film is nearly 15 years old  it hasn't aged in my eyes. But I'm biased - I loved Spaced  as well as the two films that follow this  Hot Fuzz and The World's End. Even if you don't love gore and zombies  there is still plenty of heart that you'll enjoy in this film.",positive

Then there's something interesting that goes on as Edgar Wright gets enveloped in making a pure zombie movie  and  for me  odd as it sounds  it doesn't totally work. I could understand why the shift comes  as danger looms in with the un-dead taking over the British village Pegg and Frost have to defend at all costs. At the same time  it's not quite as fulfilling as the razor-sharp satire and visual wackiness that went on in the main chunk of the picture. This being said  it's the kind of ""cult"" movie that works at its best because it feeds off of said previous ""cult"" movies like a flesh-eater on an intestinal tract; it knows how stupid it would be  however entertaining in an abstract way  if the un-dead started to rise and took over a little town or suburb or other. ""Let's go to the pub"" isn't too far of a stretch for these guys as the mall was in Dawn of the Dead.As it stands  from having seen the film quite a while ago  it stays fresh in your mind for a while  for what works wonderfully in its violent and absent-minded glory (hmm  what's really going on here  is the tone for the first part)  as well as a plum supporting role from Bill Nighy  and from what doesn't quite work. The last section  unfortunately  doesn't quite strike up the same level of delirious humor that it should  and ironically compared to the original Dawn of the Dead's last section  it's dead-pan without being hilarious  and just a straight-forward horror-fest. Which is fine  but the shift is sort of jarring and something that I didn't think quite recovered by the end of the film  albeit with the nice wink in the final shot. It's the kind of good British comedy that works best with a bunch of friends and a totally tuned-in sense of humor...or  perhaps  just someone looking for a different level of social satire with their zombie movie.",negative

The intentions of cast and crew are good  there are plenty of good gags and the characters are likable but overall it feels like something is missing. It sure isn't obvious to mix a splatter-horror subgenre with comical situations so the premise of this 'Shaun of the Dead' doesn't work all the time. Nevertheless  there's enough ingeniousness and originality to make this a worthwhile film. The setting of a grey  banal London suburb with its typical inhabitants suits the story really well and the actors do their absolute best to provide this film with a human character. But it's not as hilarious as it looks and it's simply impossible to uphold a light-headed atmosphere when you're dealing with an apocalyptic theme. In case you're not familiar with the plot: 29-year-old Shaun is stuck in his monotonous life of dead-end job  nagging mother and lowlife roommate. His more ambitious girlfriend breaks up with him and just when he plans to make some serious changes to win her back  a mysterious disease resurrects the dead and turns the living into an endangered species. While the army of ravenous zombies keeps on growing  Shaun rescues his girl and some friends by bringing them to their favorite pub. Some of the gags (like when the gang learns to move like zombies in order to keep a low profile) are really good but the film is a bit too long and the drama eventually overrules the horror. Actually  the very best aspects in 'Shaun of the Dead' are the numerous references towards milestone zombie movies  but I fear these sublime findings are a bit lost on wider audiences. Shaun of the Dead brings homage to the Romero trilogy  The Evil Dead and many Italian classics. For true horror fans  it's a joy to track down all the subtle tributes. Overall  this gem sure is worth renting but the hype in enjoys at the moment is a bit unmerited.,positive

There's the world of the viewer  from which the simple artifacts of troubled relationships are drawn. At a rather precise rhythm  this is brought to the front  no matter what else happens.Then there's the layer of the pubgoers  Shaun and girlfriend. And under that is the world of the zombies. Ted's law is that when you have a film within a film  the abstract distance between the first and second is exactly the same as between the second and third. The film starts with Liz telling her boyfriend that she doesn't want to be with him any more because she is afraid she will become a zombie. The boyfriend goes around the room and takes apparent zombies and makes up a film for each one: gangsters  porn and so on.Then  we fall into a movie within the movie as effortlessly as an unwanted  even disturbing song comes up on the jukebox. It all centers on whether the pub is the place for zombies or non-zombies. Every action  every scene is drawn from prior films  and not always straight horror films.A dog can only look down the levels  never up. Except maybe. In the end  our hero has avoided the pub zombie disease; his buddy has not  which means he is pretty much at the end as he is in the beginning.'Stacy  Schoolgirl Zombies ' is another  more obvious example.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.,positive

Then flesh-chomping zombies suddenly start to take over the city and Shaun is thrust into the mix as a potential saviour of his family and friends.In 1999 a Channel 4 sitcom called Spaced  written by Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson  and directed by Edgar Wright  become a massive cult hit because of its pop-culture references  sharp music  movie geekery and jokes  lots of jokes. Shaun Of The Dead is born out of an episode of that show called ""Art "" where a sketch had a drug induced Pegg fighting off a Resident Evil inspired zombie invasion. For the big screen outing Wright again directs with Pegg and many of the Spaced cast also turning up for the fun and horror frolics.Shaun Of The Dead is of course a play on George Romero's Dawn of the Dead  something that straight away sets the marker for exactly what type of film to expect. With ""Shaun"" the makers are proudly homaging and parodying a genre of film they so obviously love. In fact one can have enough of a good time just spotting the horror reference's and links that dot themselves throughout the picture. However  in amongst the frivolity  and there is much of that  is the point that zombies amble thru real life frequently. There is a chance that as you laugh here  you will also be faced with a horrified recognition of every day life. So with that  Shaun Of The Dead comes close to being a dark comedy masterpiece. It's not for nothing that our main protagonists and hero's in waiting are slackers extrordinair  life struggler's who's only solace is beer and video games. Think about it!.Falling down just a touch with its eagerness to contain some serious moments  ""Shaun"" does however deserve its place on any list containing great horror comedies  and not just British ones either. Perhaps surprisingly  because of its very British sensibility  it has proved very popular with American audiences  more so thru its various disc releases. Notable fans such as Romero himself and horror writing tsar Stephen King have stepped forward to voice approval. If it at times it feels like it's a bunch of mates making a horror comedy  that's because it is. And hooray to that because cinema  and the sub-genre the film belongs too  is all the better for it. The team from here went on to make the brilliant action cop homage Hot Fuzz  and at some point we will see the completion of their ""ice-cream"" trilogy with the release of The World's End.

Strangely becoming a cult hit on the international scene didn't tarnish its reputation and it spent several years in the IMDb Top 250 and now all most ten years after its release it still has an average user rating of 8 . Very strange I say very strange because it's not really a film I have ever got in to . I think it's because the plot is a one trick pony - man wakes up to find zombies roaming around and doesn't realise it until it's almost too late . It's very often a bad idea when segments of a film has the audience one step ahead of the characters . Perhaps not so much a bad idea but the makers have to do something to grab the audiences attention and here in my opinion they've failed . There's also the added problem that Danny Boyle's quasi Zombies that can run faster than an Olympic sprinter had come out at the same time so the undead here who stagger around aren't much of a menace to the characters If the film has anything going for it then it's the editing which is quite impressive as one scene segues in to another but apart from that I wasn't too impressed by any other of the aspects of the film . A lot of people here have mentioned Channel 4 sit-coms such as SPACED and BLACK BOOKS which other shows I've found it difficult to get in to so I guess the producers know what their market is,positive

Add to that a very promising trailer  the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors)  and interest was higher.High expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché  but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was  though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films  'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.It's an incredibly well-made film visually  with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to  and enhances  the unease and sense of dread. That the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself  one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes. Being somebody who considers music important when talking about it  the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view)  that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively. Despite how it sounds  'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front  with the thriller elements being taut  suspenseful and unsettling  the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored  and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still. While all the performances are very fine  it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most. My only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film  to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note. Until then  the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones  brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive

Styistically  it's similar to the likes of IT FOLLOWS  very well shot throughout and with an emphasis on the reactions of the actors involved rather than telling the story through flashy narration or fast editing. In terms of the story  I found it quite predictable  and it does seem to drag out the mystery endlessly at the outset when it's quite obvious what's going on. However  the ending certainly pays off and some finely-judged performances from the lead actors make this a satisfying viewing experience overall.,positive

Chris is worried that they're going to be put off by him being black but Rose assures him that they're not racist. At first Chris is welcomed by mom (Catherine Keener) and dad (Bradley Whitford) but soon he begins to realize that something isn't quite right.Jordan Peele wrote and directed this film  which pretty much came out of nowhere and became a huge hit with critics and it was an even bigger hit with crowds. I don't think anyone would have guessed that this film would have made the amount of money that it eventually did but it's refreshing to see. GET OUT is certainly a rather strange picture and it's one I'd call ""liberal horror"" and I'd also lump DON'T BREATHE into that genre. I think both films are incredibly interesting and the best part about both of them is the fact that afterwards you can have a discussion about their politics  which is something not too common for a horror picture.For the most part this was a very impressive horror film but I'm not even sure I'd call it a horror movie. I'd probably lean towards calling it a mystery with a pinch of thriller thrown in. The film really plays out like a great episode of The Twilight Zone as we got a terrific setting  a racial undertone and some great performances that keep you guessing at what's going on. We really don't figure out what's happening until there's about twenty-five minutes left to go in the film and I must say that Peele did a wonderful job in the director's chair by having the film hold your attention. Obviously there's a strong screenplay that manages to hold your attention even when there's not much action going on.The film also benefits from some terrific performances. Kaluuya is certainly wonderful in the lead role as he has a lot of different emotions to play. Not only is he the fish out of water but his character is also given some personal drama that plays out throughout the film. Williams is also extremely good because she's playing someone that you don't know where the character stands. She has to walk straight down the line to keep the mystery going and she does so perfectly. Both Keener and Whitford are extremely good as well as is Marcus Henderson.As I said  the racial and political elements are right in your face and it's refreshing seeing a horror movie that doesn't shy away from this. The alternate ending is actually a lot better than what's on the theatrical cut but it's easy to see why it was changed. Heck  I'm shocked that the screenplay was even able to get funding. I think the first hour is much better than the final thirty-five minutes and especially when the mystery is finally revealed. I'm not going to spoil anything but GET OUT certainly makes you discuss what it's about afterwards.",positive

They go to visit her affluent parents in the country. Her father (Bradley Whitford) insists that they're Obama supporters. Her psychiatrist mother (Catherine Keener) hypnotizes Chris to stop his chain smoking. Her brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) is a douche bag. They have a neighborhood get-together. It starts with some awkward comments. There is something more to the supposed upper-class liberal white social circle.This is a surprising project from comedian Jordan Peele. He's injecting a fresh take on the horror genre. It is tackling racism from a new perspective. It would be nice to have Chris and Rose in the regular world in the beginning to set a baseline with their black friends. As in most modern movies  the trailer gives away the movie. I feel that the twist would be more compelling otherwise. It's still a very effective horror satire of the modern world.***** spoilers *****The brain transplanting is problematic for me. Obviously  the flash brings back the hosts' minds but their brains are presumably scoped out. It makes no sense that they can come back from that. I assumed that the hypnotism had subjugated the hosts leaving them slaves to their commands. That would make more sense but I do understand Jordan Peele's attempt at subverting the liberal admiration. It isn't the obvious path and makes less logical sense.,positive

The fact is that there exists a group of evil people that have developed a way to use kidnapped victims for scientific purposes. Their motivations are really quite personal and self serving. But unless you are willing to accept that this can be done  then it's no movie. Much science fiction is based on things that are impossible. The bad guys seem to be interested in picking on black people for some reason. But the plot says they do. Peele uses black humor (excuse the term but I mean it in the general sense) and manages to get some of his own experiences to tell a story. I thought it was unique  interesting  and entertaining.,negative

Obviously he worked on several other projects as a writer  but when it comes to directing  it is his very first effort and for that it is quite a surprisingly strong achievement  also because there are no co-directors or anything in here. And the cast of this 105-minute film is also not exactly packed with superstars  even if Catherine Keener is of course a 2-time Oscar nominee and fans of Girls will recognize Allison ""Marnie"" Williams and fans of Transparent or ""The West Wing"" will recognize Bradley Whitford. But for me that's it I guess  even if I probably should have known that female housekeeper actress for how amazing she was. Lead actor Daniel Kaluuya I cannot say I know at all  even if I have seen ""Kick-Ass 2"" and ""Sicario""  so yeah this film proves that you don't need a spectacular cast of big names to come up with a quality piece because this is exactly what this film is and while all the actors are doing basically a good job  I think it is really much more about the writing than the individual performances.It all starts relatively simple when a young couple drives to the countryside where the (Black) guy is about to meet her parents for the first time after being a couple for 4-5 months. But things take a turn for the dark side fairly quickly  when gruesome dreams  strange behavior by family and employees of the house and a really bizarre social event happen the very same weekend. What is going on? You really should watch for yourself. Lets go on with some spoilers now  so maybe stop reading here if you haven't seen the picture yet. I read that people compared this film to Blair Witch Project  one of my all-time favorites  but I personally saw it more of a modern version of Rosemary's Baby (without babies obviously)  also with Williams' character and the doubts if she was in on it all or not. But when there is that scene with the housekeeper and the mobile phone and right after the protagonist tells his girlfriend the housekeeper comes in and apologizes  it becomes pretty obvious what Williams' character is all about. Completely aside from the horror side  this film is also a pretty hilarious take on black-and-white stereotypes. Random mentions of Tiger Woods  a lion cuddly toy on the night desk and there is a lot more to that. Very well-done and all these films that fail when it comes to this admittedly complicated subject can learn a lot from Peele here.At the end  the film's medical component almost has a touch of Human Centipede and it was pretty hilarious how he kept killing them one by one. Oh yeah speaking about the stereotypes I mentioned earlier  I must admit that the very first scene confused me. I thought it was the main character (or his best friend) and a bit of a preview  but apparently it was another character entirely. So much for one Black guy looking like the next to us Whites. I just mentioned the best friend and he is the one who brings most of the comedic value here  even if that gardener running wildly at night was also pretty hilarious for some reason. Of course  there was a moment here and there that I did not like too much  like the hypnosis scene early on or the blind guy introducing himself or the way that the best friend really does come out of nowhere to be the savior at the very end or the previously mentioned very first scene that was okay  but I did not really see the connection  even if the scene itself was pretty strong. I guess it was supposed to show us how they get these Blacks!? Anyway  this first scene also shows that there will be several jump scares  so it is up to you to decide if you like them. But even if I am not the biggest fan of these  I must say they all worked fairly nicely and they also made sense which is even more important. The girl sitting next to me at the theaters really was shaken every single jump scare. But there is nonetheless depth to this film  not just the race aspects that were pretty smart  but you also find many metaphors and symbolisms in here like the way they kill the deer early on and how he eventually kills Whitford's character with the deer head. So all in all  this film was a delight and I would almost call it a must-see. One of 2017's very best from what I have seen so far and a tense thrill ride for 100 minutes. What are you waiting for? Best to be watched at a theater or at least with lights out entirely.",positive

In some ways it reminded me of the remake of The Stepford Wives.Daniel Kaluuya plays Chris Washington who is on a weekend visit to the parents of his white girlfriend Rose. (Allison Williams). Her father is a neurosurgeon and her mother is a hypnotherapist.The family come across as an inclusive affluent liberal family who welcome this young black man. Chris however feels perturbed  even suspicious especially as he believes he has been hypnotised by Rose's mother.At a family garden party Chris finds that their friends and neighbours although welcoming also take an unusual interest in him. Something is not right and even Rose might be complicit to whatever is going on.The film directed by Jordan Peele is actually very slow to get going but does leave you intrigued as to how it will all turn out  even hinting that what is going on might all be in Chris's mind. British actor Daniel Kaluuya has a wide eyed look of a lamb being led to slaughter. Comic relief is provided by his best buddy Rod  a TSA agent who finds incidents of young black men who have disappeared and forms a bizarre theory.Like a lot of horror films  much of it in retrospect does not make too much sense.,positive

The first half is great and Walter  Georgina and Andre Hayworth look like characters from the 1975 ""The Stepford Wives"". The second half becomes a joke and the happy ending does not fit well to the story with so many holes and evidences against Chris. Allison Williams is amazing  changing her behavior from a lovely girlfriend to a cruel woman. Catherine Keener is also excellent in the role of a cold hypnotherapist. Daniel Kaluuya performs a non-charismatic character and the impact would be greater with an actor with more personal charm to perform Chris. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Corra!""

What I got reminded me of Black Mirror in terms of its tone and dark but yet slightly comic material. The plot starts with an oddly racial situation  where the family are well meaning and accepting  but at the same time not in a way where the black/white divide is not clearly present in some way. From here it starts to add gentle shifts of tension and a creeping sense of unease and dread across the plot. It is this element that works best because it provides engagement  leading to a reasonably short period of reveal and resolution - this final section working best because of the investment in the mystery side.The film is well paced to do this  and the plot is satisfying in the way that it uses race  but at the same time stands on its own feet without it being a theme if you don't see it or want it. First and foremost it is a horror  and it is an effective one. The cast work really well from top to bottom. Kaluuya leads the film well  and is convincing in all his moments. Williams is good  and holds her own alongside Whitford  Root  and Keener. Howery gets his performance just right - he could easily have been too much comedy  but he hits his marks importantly.Get Out is a smartly created horror/chiller where race is used as a strong foundation  but not in a way that the film forgets what it is trying to do.,negative

Kaluuya was outstanding  and I'll certainly be taking an active interest in his career from now on  hopefully awards will follow. Catherine Keener never disappoints  she provided the scene of the film for me  the therapy session  providing a moment of sheer terror.Somehow too dark to be classed as a black comedy  but the satire was definitely apparent.

The combination of being funny but also scary is a difficult one  but the movie walks that fine line very nicely. Some people took issue with the theme and the bad guys in this and how or rather what they represented. But if you really have issues with that  than the issue lies within yourself.

So while the movie delivers stereotypes and plays with them  it also shows things that are lying there - some are in the open others are more hidden. Still racism and discrimination is a thing - why not have ""fun"" depicting it and hopefully learn something from it?",negative

Let me try to take a stab at this from a different direction. My feeling is that the Armitage family was targeting Blacks not because they were racist  but because they recognized the superiority of their chosen victims. We get our first hint of that when Jeremy's (Caleb Landry Jones) dinner conversation turns to acknowledging Chris's (Daniel Kaluuya) athletic looking physique and commenting that he (Chris) would have been a 'beast' if he took up martial arts. When the black maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) apologizes to Chris for unplugging his cell phone  she makes it a point to mention that she's treated like 'one of the family'. The thing is  she WAS one of the family; it was her body that was used to accept transfer of the brain of Rose's grandmother. Walter  the groundskeeper (Marcus Henderson)  was the receptacle for the brain of the Dean Armitage's (Bradley Whitford) father; the guy looked like a world class sprinter when he buzzed by Chris during that night time  fresh air walk. So I ask  was the Armitage family racist? They could just as easily have procured white victims for their life extending pursuits  but apparently they saw something in Blacks that resonated beyond color.Be that as it may  I thought this film did quite the one hundred eighty degree U-turn from a racially tolerant set-up to the dark  horror filled picture it turned into. And the way it was balanced with humor was quite the scream. Chris's buddy Rod (LilRel Howery) was hilarious expounding on his 'sex slave' theory  and when he showed up at the finale to make the save  you could see his pride in representing TSA agents everywhere. I thought Allison Williams did a fine job as well  arcing her character from a supportive fiance to a diabolical participant in the Armitage plot. In the lead role  Daniel Kaluuya was also superb; my first look at him as an actor was just a while ago in the Black Mirror episode 'Fifteen Million Merits'. With this picture  I think he's well on his way to a fine career.,positive

It might be a surprise that he directed a horror movie  but he did. And his ""Get Out"" is a horror movie that serves as a biting satire. Basically  it's a look at how white people will often get into black culture but still won't accept blacks as their equals. Think about it: how many white people enjoyed Chuck Berry's songs but would've refused to let him come into their businesses? I don't know that I would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece  but I won't deny that it's one of the cleverest things that I've seen all year. A mixture of horror  drama and comedy that addresses the continuing racial strife in the 21st century (once thought dead due to Obama's election but made apparent due to murders of unarmed blacks by the police).Good movie.",negative

Basically  black photographer Chris Washington (Psychoville's Oscar  BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are preparing for a weekend trip to meet her parents  Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener). Upon arriving at the Armitage home  Chris is curious why the servants are all black  including groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson) and housekeeper Georgina (Betty Gabriel). Chris talks about his family  and shares that when he was eleven-years-old. his mother died in a hit-and-run. Missy  as a psychiatrist  offers to help him quit smoking through hypnosis  he declines. Rose's brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) arrives and the entire family has dinner with Chris. That night  Chris goes outside for a smoke  he notices the strange behaviour of Walter and Georgina. Upon reentering the house  Missy asks him to sit down. He explains his guilt for not calling 911 following what happened to his mother. Using the stirring of spoon in a china cup  Missy hypnotises Chris  he is unable to move  and is transported into his consciousness into a dark void Missy calls the ""Sunken Place"". Chris wakes up in bed  believing he had a nightmare  but he finds an urge to stop smoking. The Armitages have an annual get together  with many guests arriving. Chris in uncomfortable to find they are white  older couples  with an uncanny interest in him  with a lot of mention of his race. But there is also a black guest  Andrew Logan King (Lakeith Stanfield)  who unsettles Chris with his strange behaviour. Chris calls his best friend  TSA (Transportation Security Administration) Officer Rodney ""Rod"" Williams (Lil Rel Howery). He tells Rod about the hypnosis and the strange behaviour of the black people. Chris later takes a photograph  the camera flash causes Logan to freeze  have a nosebleed  and hysterically yell at Chris to ""Get out!"". Dean claims this reaction was an epileptic seizure  but Chris is unconvinced. Chris tells Rose about being uncomfortable with things  she agrees to leave with him. Meanwhile  the guests  supposedly playing bingo  are seen having an auction  for Chris  with blind art dealer Jim Hudson (Stephen Root) placing the winning bid. Whilst packing  Chris sends the picture of Logan to Rod  who recognises him as an old acquaintance  Andre Hayworth. Chris is also disturbed to find a number of photographs of Rose with previous ""boyfriends""  all of which are black men. He tries to escape  but the family block his path  and Rose reveals herself as being part of the plot. Chris is hypnotised and incapacitated by Missy. Rod becomes concerned when Chris has not returned home or answered his calls. Rod discovers more about Andre Hayworth and other black men going missing  but he is unable to convince the police to take him seriously. Chris wakes strapped in a chair  he learns that the family have developed pseudo-immortality. Neurosurgeon Dean transplants the consciousness of his older friends and family into the bodies of young black people. Jim Hudson will use Chris's body to regain his sight  Chris will doomed to exist in the Sunken Place while Jim controls his body. Chris manages to escape  blocking his ears with chair cotton  to avoid hypnosis. He kills Dean  Missy and Jeremy in the process. As he drives away  he hits Georgina  he has the same feeling of guilt as he did with his mother. When Georgina  it turns out she is a vessel for Rose's grandmother  she revives and becomes violent  causing Chris to crash  killing Georgina. Rose and Walter catch up to Chris  Rose is armed with a rifle  while Walter  a vessel for Rose's grandfather  tackles Chris. But a flash from Chris's phone camera frees Walter from hypnosis. Walter takes Rose's gun and shoots her in the gut  and then shoots himself in the head. Chris grabs the gun  but cannot bring himself to kill Rose. A police car pulls up  Rose cries out for help  trying to make out Chris is her attacker. But the driver is Rod  he and Chris drive away  while Rose succumbs to her gunshot wound and dies. It is a simple story  a young black man experiencing anxiety meeting his girlfriend's lovd ones  but then it becomes increasingly weirder and more deadly  paranoia becomes terror. It works well with the uneasy situations  the racist undertones adds to the creepiness  but there is also room for some laughs amongst the scary stuff  it is a most inventive and intriguing horror. It won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Jordan Peele (the first black writer to win)  and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year  and Best Director for Jordan Peele  it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay  and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.

We then switch to our protagonist Chris  another young black man  who is preparing to meet his white girlfriend  Rose's  parents for the first time. She assures him that they aren't racist but liberal to the point of cliché. Once at their large rural home Chris soon starts to feel uncomfortable; their black maid and gardener seem like characters from before the civil rights era and while outwardly friendly there is something a little off about the family. Rose's mother hypnotises him to stop him smoking but he is convinced that she did something more. A party thrown by the family only makes him more concerned but by the time he realises the real danger it may be too late.I found this to be a really effective horror movie even though it features little obvious threat till the very end. In many ways I was reminded of 'The Wicker Man'; a protagonist goes somewhere of his own free will  finds things somewhat creepy then finally learns a horrifying truth. There were also obvious 'Stepford Wives' vibes with the way the other black characters at the family home and their neighbours behaved. As the film progressed the tension was constantly raising and although it was obvious that something bad was planned for Chris I didn't guess just how bad until he was told what it was. Some levity was provided by Chris's friend Rod  who was convinced that rural white folk wanted black men as their sex slaves! Daniel Kaluuya does a really fine job as Chris; he is rarely off screen and is convincing throughout. The supporting cast; notably Allison Williams as Rose and Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford  as her parents are also impressive. Writer director Jordon Peele did a brilliant job; it is hard to believe this was his directorial debut. While it is obvious that there is a racial subtext to the story it doesn't feel like the viewer is being lectured to. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to horror fans who don't demand frequent violence.,positive

The only thing that I did know about it was the fact that it was a horror movie  and I do enjoy horror movies quite a lot.I will say that the movie does start out quite alright  albeit it doesn't really have that horror genre feel to it. But the story soon takes a turn into a more bizarre twist. And I mean that in a good way  because the way the story was constructed and set up was actually quite intricate and interesting. Director and writer Jordan Peele managed to introduce an element of confusion to the movie  which keeps the audience in the dark and have the audience guessing at just what exactly is going on. And that was a great accomplishment and definitely something that added a dynamic layer to the movie.And while the story did seem quite odd and bizarre  it was actually a really good story  and it turned out to be quite interesting and actually well-thought through.Director Jordan Peele was able to skillfully introduce some great build ups of drama  tension and suspense throughout the course of the movie. And the climaxes of these build ups were equally well brought to realization as well. Again  this really added a lot of depth and worth to the movie.Furthermore  the movie was really helped a great long way by having some really good acting performances by the cast. I must admit that I was especially impressed with Daniel Kaluuya's performance and how at ease he seemed to be in this role. And I was also quite impressed with Betty Gabriel  although I think it was a shame that her role wasn't bigger and that she only had limited screen time.The odd dialogue by various characters thought-out the entire movie actually makes sense when the revealing of what actually was happening took place. I will be the first to admit that I was quite puzzled and was wondering about much of the dialogue throughout the movie. But when the plot was revealed  and you look back at the dialogue it all just makes perfect sense.""Get Out"" is labeled as a horror mystery  but I would say that the mystery aspect of the movie far outweighs the horror aspect. But then again  I would say it is more of a thriller than it is a horror movie. Regardless  then ""Get Out"" is quite an entertaining and interesting movie.For a directorial debut for Jordan Peele then ""Get Out"" is quite an accomplishment. I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie  and can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch ""Get Out"".",positive

Chris is worried that Rose hasn't told them that he is black  but she assures him that they won't be the slightest bit bothered about his race. As it happens  his colour turns out to be the least of his worries as his growing suspicions that there is something very sinister afoot at the Armitage house turn out to be well founded.Not long after Chris arrives at Rose's parent's house  matters begin to get weird  Mr and Mrs Armitage's affable behaviour a little too perfect  while their home help  maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundsman Walter (Marcus Henderson)  act in a manner that can best be described as freakin' bizarre. A party for friends and family introduces more strange characters into the mix  most of whom are politely racist. Something clearly isn't right about this picture  but the viewer is wisely kept as much in the dark as Chris  while director Jordan Peele exhausts all of the possible paranoia/conspiracy angles. All the strings are pulled together in the final act  in which Peele reveals the outlandish truth  going for tension and scares  with just a little gore for good measure.As a Caucasian  I guess I could take offence at the film's portrayal of white folk  who  with no exception  are evil bastards who covet the physically superior body of the African American.

The first time you experience the film much the same way the main character does  as in any thriller where we are looking at things through the protagonists eyes - the best comparison I can make is to how Roman Polanski does this in his films  not just Rosemary's Baby (though this is what is closest to in horror movie spirit) but also Chinatown and The Ghost Writer  with the sense of oddness and outsider-ness becoming clearer with each encounter - and while there are some surprising revelations there's a greater sense of 'Oh  I hope what I actually suspect about this supporting character isn't true... oh  but it is  so why is he/she acting this way'. The last act is the most conventional as far as where it needs to go as a horror film  but the intensity comes more from character revelations and interactions  the meat of the drama in the suspense of who the 'other' is and what information is being withheld from us (also Hitchcock comes to mind as the typical but surefire comparison). Also  it's entertaining as all hell.The second time  you get to experience things in a different way and can try to spot subtler things  or moments that reveal things that are curious. For example  after the main couple Chris and Rose hit the deer  two things: 1) does Peele mean for the deer to be analogous to our protagonist  the old ""deer in the headlights"" bit? Or is it something to do with the roadkill aspect  or how a deer is used as a prop (we see this later in the basement level of the house). 2) that scene with the cop  where he asks Chris for his ID. What I wondered this time was not if Chris ever experienced this before  which he clearly has (it's a given for practically every black man or woman in this country when it comes to dealing with the police *at their best*)  but if Rose has. Is she doing what she does in front of this cop  acting in the credulous ""WTF Cop?!"" manner to get on Chris's good side  or is she genuinely posing the white  ignorant-innocent side of it where  hey  you shouldn't have to do something that's unfair  like  c'mon  you know? Although Rose ends up (spoiler) being an extremely deceitful character - she's a pro at what she does  we later learn  which is both expected but kind of a bummer - this interaction with the cop feels genuine... or is it? There's a surface level part of it and a lower level that could be dissected further  but I'll leave others to speculate.Another thing along these lines is the brother character Jeremy  played with a special level of sleaze (like out of an exploitation film  or even blaxploitation like one of those white villains in the 70's movies) by Caleb Landry Jones. He's the only white person who doesn't put on an air of sophistication - even Stephen Root  who may be the one who can try to talk without some level of condescension  is still part of the ""system"" that is controlling and enslaving blacks - but while Jeremy doesn't come out and just say it (he can't because  you know  story reasons) - and it makes for an interesting dynamic. He doesn't have many scenes  but those few he has stands out; among the whole white cast he's the one who isn't a phony  or at least he's not exactly putting on an 'act' like those at the white auction party midway through the film. You (or at least I) can feel the contempt he has for Chris right away. It may arguably be too much  like it's giving too much away how there's something not right with him  and it's different than with the Walter and Georgina characters. The second time around too the best friend Rod (Lil Rel Howery  who is mostly a stand up comic  and it kind of feels it) worked better for me. He was funny and a good presence the first time  but I also wondered if it felt not tonally consistent with the rest of the film (not that it's jarring in the sense of completely taking me out of it  clearly in the quasi-conventional sense as a script  Chris needs a best friend character)  but that his humor was a different tone than that of the rest of the movie. However he is integral to the plot  at least to an extent (Chris may be one segment of the audience  but Rod are the ones who will talk at the screen - and at times in this movie it's not completely wrong to do so  depending on the crowd one's with)  and I found him funnier the second time too; he is a capable person and is not dumb  which is refreshing in any thriller/horror movie. There are no dumb characters here  only characters who know more than what's going on at times than others  and that can make for a compelling film when done right.Get Out is a movie that is familiar in its construction in some ways  but is completely fresh in execution  with its sense of surrealism - the ""Sunken Place"" feels like it could've been an element out of Under the Skin's ""Other"" place - its befuddlement as much as rage at such a system that in many ways is analogous to how whites have treated blacks over the past centuries (whether as actual slaves or as the servants that are seen here)  and that it is as sharp and vicious a social satire as George Romero at his best  not to mention every performance firing on all cylinders (Williams and Keener by the way have a lot of subtlety to explore on a second go around).",positive

This doesn't feel right!,2-Mar-18,"I've been a fan of horror movies and thrillers ever since I figured out how the TV worked. Always preferred older movies but also always kept my eyes and mind open for new instant classics. The problem is that so very few REALLY good horror movies come out nowadays  and when I read exaggeratedly praising and positive reviews about an alleged new masterpiece  I automatically become skeptical. Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" was such an example. Literally everybody  acclaimed critics as well as ordinary mainstream audiences  was mad-raving enthusiast about ""Get Out"" and now it's even nominated for several Oscars  including best picture and best screenplay! I honestly must admit I never expected that a film like this would ever become nominated for the most important categories in such a hypocrite and predetermined contest for the elite. It'll never win  of course  but still. It must be underlined that ""Get Out"" isn't groundbreakingly original  extremely intelligent or a genuine masterwork of scripting. There are  however  many things that the film - and the debuting director Jordan Peele in particular - does exceptionally well. First and foremost  the atmosphere! Although not featuring any graphic violence for the largest part of the film  the atmosphere is continuously ominous and hinting at something dreadful that can occur at any given moment. There's only a very selected number of classic horror films that uphold the ""there's something terribly wrong here"" sentiment for so long  and it provides ""Get Out"" with the same unique vibe as pure classics like ""Seconds""  ""Rosemary's Baby""  ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""The Stepford Wives"" (the 1975 original  of course  not the idiotic Nicole Kidman remake). Secondly  you just cannot surpass Peele's truly unsurpassable approach of racial differences! Without explicitly mentioning about racial tension or introducing obviously racist characters  Peele shows that racial segregation is irreversibly integrated in our modern day social culture. This aspect of ""Get Out"" is indescribably unique  in fact. The harder the protagonists try to profile themselves as anti-racist  the more uncomfortable you get with them. Equally brilliant in this domain are the setting  costumes and tiny little details. The word ""slavery"" is never said out loud  yet look at the Armitage mansion  the style of their household staff and the crucial role of cotton at a certain point. Thirdly  and this is a joint effort with the ensemble cast  the performances in ""Get Out"" are extremely high standard. Atypical role or not  Daniel Kaluuya truly deserves the Best Actor nomination for his depiction of the insecure  skeptical and visibly petrified Chris Washington. What's the story about  then? Well  I'm convinced that ""Get Out"" is one of those films for which they invented the rule of: ""the less you know the better"". Personally  I think that even rudimentary elements like the title or the cast list already reveal too much. If I was Jordan Peele  I would have named the film ""What is happening here?"" or ""This doesn't feel right""  but of course I respect their choice from a marketing point of view. I'm well aware of the fact that most reviews provide at least a brief synopsis or hint at vital twists in the third act  but my advice is to know as little as possible before you watch. I can't finish the review without mentioning that ""Get Out"" isn't flawless. Notably the comic relief aspect  provided mainly by Lil Rel Howery   isn't the least bit impressive and even somewhat misplaced. In a way  Jordan Peele is guilty of racial stereotyping himself with this  although I reckon it was a deliberate choice. He's a comedian  after all.",negative

Expectations were that of great interest but also apprehension. Eight years ago  back when there was a personal unfamiliarity and ignorance of Stephen King's style and less appreciation for the book  there is the admission of saying don't bother with a re-make.Couldn't be more wrong. This was a case where another adaptation was not only warranted but necessary. 'IT' is such a great story that deserves to be done justice and with one of the best trailers of the year this actually looked good. However  with the other King film released this year 'The Dark Tower' being such a disappointment  there was apprehension as to whether a film based on such a huge book would work.'IT' as a book is one of King's best and one of the best of the horror genre. King's attention to detail  how he writes scenes with children and depiction of fear are unparalleled  with wonderfully drawn characters  one of the terrifying antagonists in literature and many unforgettable scenes  ones that burn long in the memory in how scary they are. The book is much more than just a horror story though  also with nostalgia  comedy  pathos and deep characterisation.'IT' was previously adapted as a mini-series in 1990  which is remembered fondly by those who saw it as children and left them terrified but often derided by fans of the book. To me  it has a lot wrong with it with a vastly inferior second half and an anti-climactic let down of an ending with the infamously terrible effects of IT's true form. But it is nowhere near one of the worst King adaptations  it's not even the worst of the mini-series. Compared to the book it's very poor  as a standalone it's wildly uneven but has more to it than Tim Curry's unforgettably magnificent Pennywise. It has a great first half with strong performances from the child actors  some unsettling moments  a 'Stand By Me'-like nostalgia and a great music score.This 2017 film adaptation is a big improvement and one of the best King adaptations in years. It does have changes  including the change in decade  not following the same structure  different IT encounters for some characters and another motivation for wanting to defeat IT. However  it is very loyal in spirit to the book that is apparent throughout. What makes it better are better production values  explanations and character motivations being more logical  Henry Bowers being more of a psychopath (and he is given a reason for why he came to be the way he is  when it was only implied once in passing previously)  Beverly's father and the relationship between the two having more of a creep factor and even better child performances.Not without its faults. Not all the special effects work  the fangs and the overdone Pennywise shaking look cheap. Mike is underused and underdeveloped compared to the others and the other bullies are pretty much given short shrift (Victor Criss practically anonymous).Some people have said that 'IT' is not scary. Personally disagree  finding it one of the scariest films seen in a long time. Not many films recently made my heart jump  covering my eyes  biting nails or stifling a scream. The Niebolt Street  bathroom  George and Pennywise and photograph/slideshow scenes especially are absolutely terrifying  and there are beautifully timed jolts  real tension and eeriness and suspenseful lead-ups  aided by atmospheric intricate lighting and clever effects for IT's forms (that leper!).With that being said  'IT' is much more than a horror film  and is more successful in its other elements. It has comedy  and it's hilarious especially with Richie and Eddie. There is an affectionate nostalgia  reminiscent of 'Stand By Me' and 'The Goonies' and reminding one of how good King was at writing scenes with children and childhood adolescence  which the writers understood and it translates brilliantly on screen. There is pathos  like with Ben's poem and the two most heart-wrenching moments are in the frightening  heart-tugging and triumphant climax. The characters are written very well on the most part  particularly Bill  Beverly and Ben  while Pennywise is evil-incarnate.Production values mostly are terrific  not just the lighting but also the beautifully realised Derry setting (Niebolt Street is a standout)  taut editing and cinematography that's both stunning and unnerving. The effects mostly are not bad  the make-up is superb and how Pennywise is made up has a creepier effect. The music score is truly haunting  ""Oranges and Lemons"" has never freaked me out this much.Andy Muschietti directs with suspense  potent realism  confidence and affection  while the writing has a great balance of hilarious comedy  touching drama and pathos  references to the time period  King and history of Derry and nostalgia. The story  even with the change of time-line and structure  is cohesive and logical  rich in suspense and emotion but it's the chemistry between the children and the sweet and surprisingly real relationship between Beverly and Ben that resonate most.One couldn't ask for better performances. The children are uniformly wonderful  especially a vulnerable Sophia Lillis  a hilarious Finn Wolfhard and a relatable Jeremy Ray Taylor. Jaeden Lieberher handles Bill's dramatic arc very touchingly while Jack Dylan Grazer is very funny. Mike and Stan are well cast. As for Pennywise  it is a very difficult feat filling the iconic Tim Curry's giant clown shoes  but Bill Skarsgard does so superbly  providing a different interpretation that never feels like a copy and has just as much chilling menace  nightmarish air and dark twisted amusement. Curry's laugh is creepier  but Skarsgard's is closer to that described in the book.All in all  brilliant and if the second film with the adults happens please have the same writer  director and Skarsgard on board  and use this as a model rather than the mini-series' second half with better cast adults and a far better ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox",positive

I like the miniseries a lot  and Tim Curry's interpretation of Pennywise remains definitive  but the 2017 IT is surprisingly decent. It has a far more adult edge than the miniseries  and it's much  much darker. It seems to capture the dark heart of the King novel very well  the very essence of it  while the real asset lies in the all-child cast; the performances are generally excellent  going for realism over sympathy or sentiment and feeling very true to life as a result. The scares are well telegraphed and perhaps a little too inevitably reliant on CGI trickery  but for a modern horror they're quite effective. I didn't mind the updating to the 1980s setting either as it makes sense to follow King's trend of setting the past scenes 27 years before the present day. Despite the flaws I found this to be one of the stronger horror films to come from Hollywood in recent years; there's something pleasingly old-fashioned about a film that emphasis strong plotting rather than a series of jumps or chases descending into tedium.,positive

One summer a group of friends realize that they are all being stalked by the vision of a sinister clown known as Pennywise. They soon realize that if they don't try to kill it then he will kill them one by one.Stephen King's IT was originally made for television in 1990 and it was a hugely successful film that scared the crap out of people. The film had all sorts of hype going into it and it actually lived up to it. The film carried on a cult following for years and then news broke that a new adaptation was coming. This film really try to create the same type of hype and it ended up being a massive box office hit. People were eating it up and it's easy to see why. With that said  as much as I loved certain parts of it there's no question that there are some major flaws as well.The great stuff includes the drama aspect of the story. The real terror comes from the bullying  the girl's sexual abuse by her father  the blame you place on yourself for your brother's death and of course there's the building of friendships that kids do during the summer. All of this is perfectly done and director Andy Muschietti does a wonderful job with the development of the characters. He also does a terrific job at capturing the mood and setting of a small town. The 1988/89 settings were perfectly captured and you can sit there and feel that you're in a real town with real characters.All of the performances by the kids are simply wonderful with Sophia Lillis and Jeremy Ray Taylor really standing out. The adult performances are just as great even though they're all basically small supporting roles. Tehn there's Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. I thought the actor was terrific in the park and I enjoyed how much more sinister this clown was. I also loved the line delivery and thought the actor was terrific at bringing this character to the screen.With that said  there are some major  major flaws that pretty much kill the horror elements of the film and that's the CGI. The CGI effects are so fake looking that I couldn't help but be taken out of the drama that was going on. This isn't a Marvel movie or some sort of fantasy. Why build up the setting so much just to throw it all away with cheap effects? And I ask you this.... Was this CGI  fake looking clown that rushes towards the camera or floats around really as creepy as the actor and his make-up? Why they had to throw these cheap  fake looking effects is anyone's guess but it really hurts the film.Overall  I'd say that the original was better but there's still a lot of great stuff here. It's really too bad that there really aren't any scares due to the fake looking effects and it's even worse that everything was there for a much better movie. As it stands  IT is good but not a classic.,positive

Bill Denbrough makes a paper boat for little brother Georgie. Georgie plays with it in the rain and it floats down into the sewers. He encounters Pennywise (Bill Skarsgård) and we're off. Bill faces the loss of Georgie with his friends Richie Tozier  Eddie Kaspbrak  and Stanley Uris. They are bullied along with new kid Ben Hanscom  home-schooled Mike Hanlon  and abused girl Beverly Marsh. There is a series of missing kids and Ben may have uncovered the disturbing cause.I am not a reader but I did watch the mini-series many years ago (not as a kid). It struck me right away that it obviously needed to be split into two movies. The kids' side could be a great horror and I didn't care for the adults' side that much. It's a decade later and they've made the kids' part of the novel. There are two trailers which really caught everybody's eye and peaked my interest.This is like a darker and more brutal Goonies or more likely  a Stand By Me with more gore. It's not a slasher torture porn. It's not super scary but that's not the objective. Honestly  I laughed more than I was scared. It is surprisingly rather funny. It is super well made. Even the cinematography is beautiful. The kids have amazing chemistry. Each one is an individual. They are fun together and natural. Their stories are honest and brutal. This version of Pennywise is creepy and much more a monster than the teasetastic Tim Curry. There are jump scares but the movie does not rely on them. They aren't that big anyways and the one with Beverly is already given away in the trailer. I would put this comfortably on the same level as the two iconic coming-of-age movies previously mentioned.,positive

I have seen director Andy Muschietti's older film Mama and I wish he could have written the screenplay for this new film himself like he did back then as what the writing trio (that is far from a bunch of nobodies) made out of it (no pun intended) here is definitely a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. But first things first: It runs for comfortably over 2 hours and tells the story of a group of kids as they fight and eventually overcome a dangerous demon in the form of a clown. The latter goes by the name of Pennywise and maybe he was the best thing about it all. Sadly  he and the film peaked already very early on in the rain/sewer scene and that one was quite amazing. There he did look like a worthy antagonist. But honestly afterward he fails on so many occasions and cannot even kill one of the kids from the group. Lets keep it family friendly shall we? Thanks  but no thanks.Now about the gang itself: I really never ended up liking or cheering for those kids. One reason for that may be the one with the glasses who is really downright annoying and as his comments were supposed to be the comedic foundation of the film  that is a perspective where the movie didn't work at all. And there's others. In general  the child actors weren't good at all and I would be surprised if we see more than 1  maybe 2  of them acting 20 years from now. The fat kid and the girl were maybe still the best of them  even if their fairy tale like kiss was also one of the weakest moments. The one with the glasses I cannot deny I wanted the clown to kill him  same for the one who got added for diversity reasons towards the end  who added nothing to the film at all. The boy being probably the closest to a lead actor  the one with the dead brother  was not particularly good either. This showed on several occasions  but of course the script did not help either. There is that one scene when he holds a speech that he'd rather enter the house of horrors than his home where his brother is missing was maybe the most cringeworthy moment of the film. You could see how they were desperately trying to make an impact in terms of drama  in terms of coming-of-age. But it all went wrong and not just on that occasion. There's maybe half a dozen more examples. So from the drama/emotional perspective  maybe even romantic perspective  it is a failure too. It was obvious how they wanted to make more than pointless horror fun with the several abuse (physical  emotional  sexual) stories  but the talent just wasn't there to make it work  let alone make it memorable. And at some point  it also isn't fun anymore to see Pennywise with his huge forehead being stopped again and again from killing any of the heroes as he really turned into a clueless impotent clown finally. I guess they still wanted to make it family friendly overall by not killing off any of the good kids except early on. That looked like a really cowardly approach to me. Eventually this film did not come close in its attempt to combine kids and horror  what is a successful formula these days if you look at Stranger Things"" for example. I see a sequel is planned for 2019  but after how weak this one turned out to be  I cannot say I am curious about that one at all. Definitely a contender for my biggest 2017 film disappointment so far. Do not watch and I had a feeling that the mix-up between reality and imagination was handled so shoddily in here that it was just beyond confusing. Maybe even the writers lost their focus as this did not turn out half as smart as they wanted it to be. Do not be fooled by the overwhelmingly positive reception. This is not a good film!",negative

He has also added a touch of The Goonies. Set in a small town back in the summer of 1989 where some of the kids run away from bigger bullies but the real malevolent force in Pennywise the sinister clown.The kids discover that disaster strikes every 27 years where children disappear and it is for them to take a stand and stop the clown.The story is built up slowly  we first see a child playing with a paper boat which goes into the drainage system where he encounters Pennywise and disappears. His brother is traumatised. Most of the early scenes are kids at school  being teenagers  getting bullied. A girl has an abusive father  one child is ill or is he? However the tension soon mounts as Pennywise taunts them  his appearance being increasingly horrific.We see a lot of the movie titles that came out in 1989 such as one of the Freddy Krueger sequels. Another is Batman  Pennywise as a hint of Jack Nicholson's psychotic Joker.It has certainly garnered a younger audience with the approach it has taken. My teenage son is not fond of clowns but he was reeled in because we follow these young teenagers and their adventures and trauma.The film does run for too long  it could had easily knocked 20 minutes off the running time and this affects the pacing of the movie. Some of the CGI looks a bit cheap as well.,negative

In the original film  the seven lead characters are adults meeting each other in Derry. Their childhood is told through flashbacks where the viewer learns their experience with the evil Pennywise when they were children and their pact to return to their hometown if necessary. ""It"" (2017) is linear and tells the same story of the seven bullied children since the disappearance of Georgie  ending with their pact to return to Derry.

The other film was made for TV and was limited it what it could do. This production only concerns the childhood and not the second part as adults. The special effects were improved to make for a far more scary and intense film. Some of the original dialogue appears and I had a few moments of deja vu. I thought the child actors were better.

It's a messed up book  with some real dark  crazy horror. Some of it translated here  some of it didn't. The famous scene where Pennywise is first seen I loved  it was terrifying  and from that first moment  I loved Bill Skarsgård  and have nothing but praise for him.People criticising the run time  clearly haven't read the book  it's a long  but rewarding book. As I now can compare the two films  I preferred this first installment. It's very well made  well acted  definitely enjoyable.Sometimes it felt more adventure then horror  it never really felt full on horror  there were some very good scenes  but they could have ramped it up a bit. Many people are terrified of clowns  they could have pushed that vibe a bit more. Lots of humour  too much though? Not sure  I didn't detect much humour in the book.I'm so glad Stephen King is on the big screen still  how about a reworking of The Tommyknockers?7.5/10,positive

The first attempt was made for TV  so that and the fact it's been a while I wouldn't be surprised if the effects are nowhere near this newer version and that makes sense.Still I do remember Tim Curry doing a phenomenal job. Something Skarsgaard had to play against. I don't think you should compare myself  but I know that some may not be able to help themselves. Whatever the case  the new clown is terrifying as well. And the effects are really good. So while horror fans and hardcore horror movie watchers may not be as overwhelmed by this then the general audience  this still is a good film overall.

That's a fear of clowns if you don't know  and if you don't know if you have a fear of clowns  you WILL know after you see this film. Bill Skarsgard's take on Pennywise the Clown in this remake of the 1980 TV mini-series is a masterful interpretation  delivered for a twenty first century audience that's been desensitized by over the top gore and horror of recent vintage. And that's not meant to take anything away from Tim Curry's portrayal in the earlier film  he brought his own brand of selective nuance to that characterization.I liked the idea that the story takes place in 1989 as opposed to the Fifties in Stephen King's novel. With a twenty seven year cycle between appearances of the evil incarnate known as Pennywise  the second chapter will bring events relatively current into a 2016 time frame. The story reinforces the 1989 time frame with a movie marquee featuring the first modern day ""Batman"" movie along with the ""Lethal Weapon II' sequel. A side view of the same theater also mentions ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5""  a nice touch for horror fans of that series.I agree with a fair number of commenters on this site that mention the natural camaraderie of the members in 'The Loser's Club'. Some of them  like Mike and Stan are underplayed a bit  but not every one of them can be a standout. The manner in which the nominal leader Billy (Jaeden Lieberher) was written was very well done  in a way that handled his little brother's death as real  but holding out some hope that maybe  just maybe there's the possibility that he's a missing person. As the viewer of course  we know that Georgie was a Pennywise victim right at the outset  even though we get teases later on in the story that the evil entity is working through the guise of Billy's little brother.As far as the scary elements go  I've probably seen enough horror films to have become somewhat jaded over the years relative to jump scare moments and other nasty surprises. The one scene I thought was outstanding was when Pennywise emerged from the slide show presentation in Billy's garage  that was exceptionally well done. What really made the film work for me was the bonding between the seven 'Losers'  all of whom entered into a blood pact to respond to a future crisis when the time should arrive. With that  the one disappointment I experienced was that there was no 'after credits' sequence to give us a hint of what to expect in the second chapter. If you hang around until the theater employees are ready to throw you out so they can clean up  all you get is that maniacal laugh from Pennywise to send you off. At least he could have popped out of the screen.",positive

The children do a fine job with their roles. Like some of Stephen King's other works - ""The Body"" (adapted as ""Stand by Me"") and ""Hearts in Atlantis"" - it does a good job showing how the adults are lousy role models  so the children join up to achieve something.

Jaeden Lieberher  Jeremy Ray Taylor  Sophie Lillis  Finn Wolfhard  Chosen Jacobs  Jack Dylan Glazer  and Wyatt Olaf are all uniformly fine and credible in their roles while Bill Skarsgard makes for a supremely frightening Pennywise. Moreover  director Andy Muschietti offers a flavorsome evocation of the late 1980's period setting (the News Kids on the Block reference is spot-on sidesplitting!)  grounds the fantastic premise in a plausible everyday small town reality  and generates plenty of nerve-rattling suspense. Better still  the spooky supernatural evil of Pennywise is nicely contrasted by such chilling real-life horrors as vicious town bully Henry Bowers (a perfectly hateful portrayal by Jarred Blancard) and Beverly's repellent pedophile father. The special effects are likewise sound and convincing  the gore is generous  but never excessive  and the overall atmosphere tense and eerie throughout. An on the money scarefest.,negative

Basically  on a rainy day in Derry  Maine  October 1988  Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher) gives his seven-year-old brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott) a sailboat made from notebook paper. Georgie sails it in the street gutter  but it goes down a storm drain  Georgie peers inside and finds a man dressed as a clown who introduces himself as ""Pennywise the Dancing Clown"" (Bill Skarsgård  Stellan's son)  the clown entices Georgie to reach in for the boat  then severs his arm and drags him in. Eight months later  June 1989  on the last day of term at Derry High School  Bill and his friends Richie Tozier (Finn Wolfhard)  Eddie Kaspbrak (Jack Dylan Grazer)  and Stanley Uris (Wyatt Oleff) face constant bullying from Henry Bowers and his gang. At the same time  young girl Beverly Marsh (Sophia Lillis)  who is being abused by her father Alvin (Stephen Bogaert)  runs into Ben Hanscom (Jeremy Ray Taylor)  who has recently moved to Derry  Mike has encounter with Pennywise. Bill is haunted by the disappearance of Georgie  he believes his brother may still be alive in the marshy wasteland called the Barrens  he recruits his friends to check it out. Ben finds a book on Derry's history  he learns the town has been plagued by mysterious unexplained tragedies and child disappearances for centuries  he escapes an attack from Pennywise  then Henry's gang  and flees to the Barrens. Ben runs into Billy's group  as they find the shoe of missing girl Betty Ripsom  after they leave  Henry's friend Patrick Hockstetter (Owen Teague) is killed by Pennywise in the sewer. The next day  each of the children have a nightmarish encounter with Pennywise  Eddie is attacked by a rotting leper  and Stan is traumatised by an animated figure from a painting. Beverly has a a fountain of blood spurting from her bathroom sink  coating the bathroom  Bill is lured into the basement by a vision of Georgie  he narrowly escapes Pennywise. Weeks later  the group  referring to themselves as ""The Losers Club""  come to realise they are all being terrorised by the same entity  ""It"" assumes the appearance of what they fear  Ben also deduces that the creature awakens every 27 years to feed on the children of Derry before returning to hibernation. The group determine It moves unseen through the sewers around Derry's well  where 29 Neibolt Street is built  Bill  Richie  and Eddie enter the house while the others remain outside. After the encounter with It  Eddie's mother arrives and is horrified by her son's broken arm  she takes him away  the group begin to splinter. It is now August  Beverly incapacitates her father with a porcelain toilet lid when he tries to rape her  she in abducted by Pennywise  Bill assembles the others to mount a rescue  meanwhile It manipulates Henry to murder his abusive father  and sends him to kill the Losers. At the Neibolt house  the group abseil down the well  Henry struggles Mike  until the bully falls down the well  apparently to his death. The group find It's lair in an underground cooling tower  filled with decaying circus props and children's belongings  there they find Beverly in a catatonic state  along with dozens of missing children corpses  floating above them. Beverly is revived with a kiss from Ben  It tries to trick Bill  appearing as Georgie  Bill shoots It in the head  Pennywise tries to take Bill hostage  but the other help and brutally fight It. It attempts to use their fears against them  but Pennywise is mortally wounded and cornered  Bill coldly tells Pennywise they know It needs their fear to survive  they have effectively starved the creature by making It afraid of them. Knowing it has no more power over the kids  It dissolves and Pennywise escapes into a deep pit  and the floating children slowly descend  Bill breaks down accepting his brother is dead  he is comforted by the others. One month later  Beverly tells the group that while catatonic she had a vision of them fighting the creature as adults  the Losers make a blood oath to return to Derry in 27 years  if It returns they will destroy the creature once and for all  one by one the Losers depart  and Bill and Beverly they share a kiss. Also starring Stuart Hughes as Officer Oscar ""Butch"" Bowers  Owen Teague as Patrick Hockstetter  Logan Thompson as Victor ""Vic"" Criss  Jake Sim as Reginald ""Belch"" Huggins and Geoffrey Pounsett as Zach Denbrough. Skarsgard gives a great performance as the disturbing nasty clown  and the seven young actors are all impressive  it is a simple story  a Stand by Me style story of a group of tween friends who bond together to fight against an ancient evil  it works well with the friendship element  and it is thrilling and scary when it needs to be  the highlights are definitely the opening  and the bathroom blasted with blood. It went on to become the highest-grossing horror movie of all time  and ended as being ""Chapter One""  so I look forward to the follow-up  a most enjoyable supernatural horror. Very good!",negative

They definitely went for a more evil and sinister feel to the movie  and Pennywise shed his family-friendly skin (that he wore in the 1990's version) and draped a cape voven of pure dread.The storyline is much familiar  if you have seen the 1990 edition  but there is so much more added to this 2017 version. It does the novel much more justice.The CGI and special effects are good  and do add a lot of spice to the movie.Pennywise was adequate  although it was a bit difficult taking him serious with those buck teeth and the way he kept pouncing towards the children. The scene where Pennywise was dancing below in the caves was also a bit too comical for my liking.The children were really doing amazing jobs with their characters and roles in this 2017 version.It was definitely worth the wait and the hype.

His is not the only great performance in director Andy Muschietti's re-imagining of the King classic: the kids who play the plucky youngsters who fight back against the monster are all excellent  with Stranger Things star Finn Wolfhard putting in a particularly memorable turn as wisecracking Richie Tozier (he gets all of the best lines!).Fright-wise  I can't say that I was ever on the edge of my seat  nor did I jump (years of watching horror films has made me difficult to scare)  but I was thoroughly entertained throughout.

Every 27 years in the town of Derry  both adults and kids mysteriously go missing (mostly kids); in fact  the woodsy community has an extremely high ratio of missing persons versus the national average. A group of young teenagers in 1989  have-nots and misfits who not only have to face their scary elders every day but also must contend with a carload of carousing school bullies  form a ""Loser's Club"" to fight the evil consuming the town. The ""It"" of the title lives down in the bowels of Derry's centuries-old sewer line  feeds on fear and manifests itself as a killer clown named Pennywise (whose harbinger is a lone red balloon). Pennywise's freaky transmutations are startling and scary  and the kids scream and cower quite naturally until they finally agree to battle It to the death. The film  which is overlong  lays on the brutality with a trowel. It is  in fact  quite vicious and ugly in its mean-spiritedness and  though some may argue this is necessary in the function of the plot  I found the physical violence inflicted on the kids so nasty as to be unsettling. The introductions of the characters aren't very promising  but the young actors do have a way of growing on you (particularly Jaeden Lieberher as William and Sophia Lillis as Beverly). These poor youngsters have it tough  with parents or guardians who are off-balanced and classmates who are out for blood. Director Andy Muschietti makes their surroundings so dangerous that one wonders how anyone survives in Derry. Still  Muschietti's presentation  helped by excellent effects  cinematography and music scoring  makes this a slambang chiller for audiences out to experience a good shudder. **1/2 from ****",positive

This movie doesn't  for example  over-crowd you with jump scares; oh  it has a couple  don't get me wrong  but they aren't so distracting that it ruins the movie (or  for that matter  have the final shot of the film be the character lunging at the camera  like it's a theme park ride and we need one more ""good"" scare)  and Andy Muschietti and his DP (who usually shoots Park Chanwook films) pour on the atmosphere here while at the same time NOT doing the thing where horror movies drain the color palette or make things blue. This is a director who trusts the audience and  as the opening weekend would show  it seems to have paid off.He's also attentive to casting everyone just right (only the young actor playing Stan Uris feels like he's just 'okay'  but that may be because everyone around him  especially the actors playing Bill and Beverly  are so fully invested in their roles  and by the way casting one of the main kids from Stranger Things to be Richie is so on the nose I love it)  and to making Derry feel like a real place - or  if not *as* much as the book does  as much as can be done in a two-hour movie. There are certainly predictable parts to the narrative  as there may have been to its source (mostly this is felt for me when it gets to the second act end and into the third  with some of the CGI in the climax being less than impressive - oh  some of it is really good  and some of it... is not).On top of everything else  Skarsgard surprises with a sinister interpretation of Pennywise. You won't get another Tim Curry performance  you just can't really  but the direction Skarsgard goes in is full of a darkness but also... well  let's put it this way  once you see that scene between Pennywise and Georgie in the opening by the sewer drain  you can believe that this clown *might* appeal to small  impressionable children before  literally  feeding off their fear as well as flesh. It's a turn where every time he came on screen and did something (with the exception of those couple of jump-scares  which made the trailer give the impression it would not be so solid)  I was smiling in not a scared expression but simply being entertained by a performer giving it his all. I really hope he gets to do a lot more things as an actor because this is a star-making turn.In closing: the critic who said in one review  ""This is not the best Stephen King movie  but it comes close  but it is the MOST Stephen King movie"" hit it on the head. It isn't great overall and yet I had a blast watching it from start to finish: it's emotional and dramatic and earns those beats; it shows friendship in childhood as a powerful and necessary thing to have and keep a hold of; it's there to scare the hell out of you if you're open to it; and it shows how a good lot of people are... really f***ing creepy. One last thing: it doesn't over-do it's 80's references  and if they're used it's either for actual plant & pay-off in the story (i.e. New Kids on the Block) or a thematic connection (Nightmare on Elm Street 5 is playing at a local theater?

Clowns always were  and always will remain scary  and horror movies with children as the lead protagonists are incredibly popular for some reason. Moreover  the plot about a sleepy little New England town terrorized by a shape-shifting demon feeding on young children is a quite timeless one. It worked in the late 1980s with a fifties setting  it works in 2017 with a late 1980s setting and it will mostly likely work again in 20-30 year  presumably with a turn-of-the-century setting. To be rather frank and abrupt  I found the original film version massively overrated and had little hope that this reboot would be any better; - even despite all the praising reviews and hypes on Internet forums. ""It"" is a very average film  with a very thin plot and exclusively relying on a few strong gimmicks. Come to think of it  the upcoming star-director Andy Muschietti was the ideal man to direct a film like ""It"". Like with his debut ""Mama""  Muschietti again masters in camouflaging a mediocre and derivative plot by throwing in a lot of spooky imagery and seemingly controversial plot aspects. Whilst watching ""Mama"" and ""It""  you quickly get the impression that they are brave and shockingly intense horror productions  but when you start analyzing them  they're not much more than substantially void tales with meticulously pre-measured jump moments. But I must be open and honest about one thing  however  namely that ""It"" has a brilliant and genuinely terrifying opening sequence! The footage of little Georgie chasing his paper boat that is floating in the pouring rain  and then subsequently getting confronted with the smooth-talking yet ultra-menacing clown Pennywise from within the sewer hole  is unbelievable tense and uncomfortable. At the exact same moment when blood stains and heavy rainfall are merging on the street  you already know the film will only be going downhill from here! Unfortunately  2 hours of film and even the credits then still have to come. The story then unfolds in a very formulaic fashion. A group of social outcast and bullied friends  aptly referring to themselves as ""The Losers Club""  prepare for a long and boring summer in their hometown Derry. One of them is little Georgie's older brother and he still can't fathom that the boy simply vanished. Together  they discover that there's a remarkably higher number of missing children cases in Derry than anywhere else and that gruesome accidents with child casualties strangely occur every 27 years. Peculiar stuff  like evening curfews and numerous ""missing children"" posters on the walls  also appear to be the most common things in Derry. Naturally  all the dreadful clichés and typical Stephen King themes quickly start to follow. Pennywise the Clown is one scary villain  but obviously the real monsters are the adults in town  like the abusive father  the overbearing mother or the violently aggressive cop-father. Outcast kids  including an asthma-patient and an obese boy  transform into brave heroes. When the Losers Club threatens to fall apart  they realize the only way to defeat the demonic Pennywise is to stick together! You know  that sort of moralist nonsense. ""It"" is at its best when the source material  King's Novel  imitates that other great novel ""The Body""  which was also written by Stephen King and turned into the magnificent film ""Stand By Me"" in 1986. Yes  King plagiarizes everybody. Even himself! No  seriously  the child actors are terrific and clearly enjoying themselves the most when they drive around on their BMX bikes and mock each other. Bill Skarsgard is excellent as well  as Pennywise  but the old rule of the horror genre still stands: the less you see of the monster  the more menacing he becomes.",negative

Local bullies like to torment the group; but terror starts as they square off with an evil clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard)  whose history of murder and grisly violence goes back for centuries.

Just to see whether they held up  as good as remembered and whether they succeeded where 'The Nun' didn't and didn't make that film's mistakes. On re-watch  'The Conjuring' does hold up very well and actually just as good as remembered. It succeeds splendidly in where 'The Nun' failed and has none of its mistakes. 'The Conjuring' is not a perfect film  but it is very atmospheric  well made and genuinely scary  or at least to me it was. It is a very familiar premise  done to death actually  but the atmosphere stops it from being too predictable and there is enough freshness. 'The Conjuring' is overlong but its biggest  and only big  problem is the final act. It did become repetitive and lost momentum at this point and the very end felt rushed. Other than those  'The Conjuring' is very good. It looks great  especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The music is haunting and not over-bearing  recorded in a way that is not overly loud or obvious that it spoils the atmosphere (which was great because many horror films seen recently failed in this regard).Script is not too awkward and is structured coherently  with nothing cheapening it like sluggish exposition or cheesy misplaced humour. The direction is meticulous in detail and clearly shows an engagement and ease with the material. The story takes time to unfold but doesn't get dull. As said too  'The Conjuring' is genuinely scary  with actual tension  suspense and dread  in a palm-sweating and heart-pounding sense at its best  while not relying too much on jump scares (they are there but have build up and were surprising).Found myself liking the characters more than expected. The leads were ones worth caring for  didn't get frustrated with them  wish for more personality or annoyed by them. The antagonist was frightening  was neither over-used or under-utilised and didn't look cheap. The acting also comes off well  especially Vera Farmiga while also impressed with how Lili Tyler coped with a role that on paper seemed limited. Summarising  very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox,negative

Unfortunately  it appears that the co-writers of the script also watched all the same movies  because this turns out to be yet another entirely predictable exercise in fear-building.I don't really have a huge problem with THE CONJURING  other than to say that it's all been done - and been done better - before. The old movies like THE AMITYVILLE HORROR and THE ENTITY just seemed to have more authenticity  better production values  and a freshness that made them more frightening. THE CONJURING  meanwhile  goes through the motions without ever offering anything even remotely resembling new.Saying that  it's pretty good by modern genre standards and a lot better than the schlocky INSIDIOUS movies  also starring Patrick Wilson. The characters played by Wilson and Farmiga are entertaining  not least because they're based on a true-life ghost-busting couple (although to credit them as the ""world's most renowned"" is insulting  given the reputation of other noted paranormal investigators in recent history such as Peter Underwood  Maurice Grosse and Guy Lyon Playfair).The film looks good  and the cast can't be faulted for really getting behind their characters. A shame  then  that Wan is severely lacking in imagination when it comes to the scares. Typically they involve spooky wardrobes  characters descending into cobwebby and unlit rooms  and loud noises on otherwise quiet soundtracks. All very predictable. And the ending goes down THE EXORCIST route again  which is disappointing. Like SINISTER  this is a film with bags of atmosphere and lots of potential which is well worth a watch for genre fans  but it lacks the magic spark to make it anything other than average.",positive

Within minutes of arriving the duo realize that they're up against something stronger than they've ever known. THE CONJURING is a very good movie that certainly deserves a lot of the hype it's getting but I'm going to stop a bit short of calling it a masterpiece or one of the best films of the genre. With that said  there's no question that director James Wan knows how to use torture (SAW) as well as scares (INSIDIOUS) but this time out he goes solely for the scares and gets quite a few very effective jump scenes. Not all of them are those fake jump scenes that are so common in horror movies today where there's a loud crash through the expensive speaker system that would make anyone jump and it doesn't have anything to do with the movie. No  there are generally some creepy scenes here that I'm not going to ruin but you'll certainly never look at hide and clap the same way again. The director also does a very good job with the 1970s setting as the entire film really does look like the movies that would have been made in that decade. The film also benefits from some extremely strong performances with Farmiga turning in another excellent performance. She's really been doing some great work over the past few years and even in a genre that a lot of people look down on. Wilson is also effective as her husband as is Rob Livingston and Lili Taylor as the haunted couple. I think the film eventually falls off its tracks during the final thirty-minutes and once the possession stuff started I just slipped out of the movie. I guess we've simply seen this stuff a bit too often and there just wasn't anything effective during these scenes. Still  the tension and creepiness throughout the first two-thirds of the film are strong enough to make this worth seeing.,positive

Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) with their kids move into a farm house. Strange things start to happen. They call in married paranormal investigators Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson).This is an old fashion haunted house scary story. This is no big twist or slasher porn. This is a rather straight forward ghost story. It hearkens back to films like Amityville or Poltergeist. All the actors are spot on. The tension builds nicely throughout the movie. My only complaint is that the ending is slightly too hectic and runs on a little but that's a very minor point. It's barely worth a mention really. It's great to have an old fashion horror done well.,positive

IMDb categorizes it as a mix of horror  mystery and thriller and I think that sums it up pretty well  even if I would say the horror component is the most dominant. It runs for 110 minutes approximately and it is probably the most known work by both director James Wan and writer Chad Hayes  who worked on the script with his twin brother Carey  or at least among the most known. The film was successful enough for a sequel and that one is also by the people I just mentioned. The cast does not really include A-listers  but that's not a problem as horror films are usually much more about the scare factor and also about the script than really about great performances. The most known name you will find in here is probably Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga. She plays one half of a duo that specializes on investigating supernatural phenomenons and the Perron family is just the perfect occasion for them and their profession. This family  parents and a whole lot of children  just moved into a house at the countryside where they quickly realize things aren't normal at all. They find out an evil spirit is haunting them and it may drive them insane. So they decide to consult Farmiga's and Wilson's characters.I personally enjoyed the first half of the film for the most part. It was nothing really new we got here  but the ways they used the unseen danger or included frightening situations were all done in a pretty competent manner. It sure manages to scare you and the camera work was done well too. Sadly  I must say the moment they really started fighting the evil spirit with the help of the married couple that is presented to us right away in the movie is when the film gets worse slowly but steadily. I did not really care for the exorcism sequences and the ways in which the Warrens/Perrons confront the enemy were also really showy  but not too memorable to me. Quite a shame because the introduction to the whole subject was pretty decent. I think the film also falls flat in really making an impact when it comes to the characters. Honestly  it felt to me as if all the family's children were entirely interchangeable and they did not seem to have any purpose in the entire project other than getting scared. Zero depth in character writing here and this also applies somewhat to the adult characters. Also the solution with the special family references about the ghost and the mother-daughter relationship they put the focus on did very little for me. This is also why at times I felt that the film took itself more seriously than it really had the right to and this went on until deep in the closing credits were we see real photos and the characters/actors linked to these. So yeah  I personally am a bit baffled by this film's awards success and strong reception. I am probably not the greatest horror film buff  but I have seen superior movies from the genre from recent years and they weren't even close to this one in terms of the strong reception. As for ""The Conjuring""  I don't recommend the watch and I have almost no interest in checking out the sequel any time soon. Thumbs down.",positive

I didn't know this picture pre-dated 2014's ""Annabelle""  so was taken aback a bit when an opening scene made use of that character. Ultimately  Annabelle's connection with the movie is not notable in and of itself  except as a centerpiece of the real life Warren's occult museum. There's a scene in the movie that's reminiscent of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" which I thought was a little too obvious given the genre but it doesn't linger too long. The horror effects in the film are rather sensational  especially those that place members of the Perron family in harm's way by invisibly and violently thrashing them around; the upside down seated Lorraine on the ceiling was particularly chilling.

Basically  set in 1971  Roger Perron (Ron Livingston)  his wife Carolyn Perron (Ransom's Lili Taylor) and their five daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell)  Nancy (Hayley McFarland)  Christine (White House Down's Joey King)  Cindy (Mackenzie Foy) and April (Kyla Deaver) have moved to Harrisville  Rhode Island into a dilapidated farmhouse. After moving in  the family find a hidden basement under the stairs  the entrance was been boarded up. Roger opens it up and inspects  and soon after strange things start happening to the family. Starting with the unexplained death of the family dog  Sadie. Over the next few nights  the family find themselves terrorised by paranormal activity. All clocks stop at 3:07am  they hear strange noises  then a nasty spirit entity starts physically attacking. Carolyn decides to contact married and noted demonologists Ed (Insidious's Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Orphan's Vera Farmiga). They agree to visit their home  and Carolyn  a clairvoyant  confirms that terrible things happened in the past. After investigating they determine that the house needs an exorcism  but they need church approval. Ed and Lorraine discover the house once belonged to accused witch Bathsheba (a relative of Mary Towne Eastey of the Salem witch trials)  who sacrificed her week-old child to the devil and killed herself after cursing all who would take her land. They find out there have been numerous murders and suicides in the house over the years. Ed and Lorraine set up cameras and bells around the house to gather evidence of a conjuring. The spirit lures one of the children while they sleepwalk  Lorraine follows her through a secret passage in the wardrobe. Lorraine suddenly falls through the floorboards  winding up in the basement. There she sees the spirit of the woman Bathsheba possessed to kill her own child. The Perron family take refuge in a hotel  while Ed and Lorraine show the Catholic Church the evidence. The Warrens daughter Judy (Sterling Jerins) is attacked in their own home  but Ed helps save them. Carolyn is possessed by Bathsheba and takes two of the children back to the house. Carolyn is found trying to stab one of the girls by Ed and Lorraine. They tie her to a chair and Ed decides to perform an exorcism on her himself. The spirit tries to kill Ed  and Carolyn escapes at one point and tries again to kill one of the children  but Lorraine reminds her of special memories she has of her family. This allows Ed to complete the exorcism  saving Carolyn and the children  and lifting Bathsheba's curse forever. Ed and Lorraine return home  they have a message for another case to investigate in Amityville  Long Island  New York. The film ends with Ed placing the music box from the house on the shelf of relics from other haunting investigations  where the strange doll Annabelle has already been placed in a box labelled never to be opened. When the room is empty  the music box inexplicably opens itself and plays music. Also starring Shannon Kook as Drew Thomas  John Brotherton as Brad Hamilton  Marion Guyot as Georgiana Moran and Steve Coulter as Father Gordon. The cast all do their parts fine  the things going bump in the night and haunted house stuff works well  the possessed doll seen a little got its own spin-off prequel  it could have been slightly more jumpy  but bearing in mind it is based on true events it is overall a fair supernatural horror.

Another creepy film in which keeps horror with yet another haunted house that causes creepy goings-on in a family such as the followings classic pictures : the original ¨Exorcist¨ film (by Friedkin) that spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as ¨Changeling¨ (by Peter Medak)  ¨Amytiville ¨(by Stuart Rosemberg) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Supernatural terror plenty of weird phenomenon   frights   scary beings   shocks   and eerie happenings . It deals with the Perron family formed by father (Ron Livingston)   mother (Lili Taylor   she researched The exorcist (1973) to prepare for her role) and five children move into an old house . Eight generations of families lived and died in the house before the Perrons moved in   but little do they know that the house is haunted . And some of the spirits from the families never left   deaths include two documented suicides  a poisoning death  the rape and murder of an 11-year old girl  two drownings  and the passing of four men who froze to death . Most deaths occurred within the Arnold family from which the nasty ghoul Bathsheba Sherman was descended . Paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson   this movie marks the third collaboration between James Wan and Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) work to help the family terrorized by a dark presence and ghastly mysteries in their farmhouse . There are three phases in this strange process : 1 : infestation   2 : oppression and 3 : possession . They are attempting to find out the bottom of rare deeds by ways of the cellar and soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks . The mediums seek to uncover the fantastic secrets that has left a witch dangerously connected to the real world .This is a haunted house movie that contains restless horror as when the invisible and threatening beings attack . It includes usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the scary entities with the ordinary ghastly shenanigans   the cracking floors   birds manifest as attackers   doors suddenly slam   screeching shouts   violent hitting   among others . Tension   creepy atmosphere   genuine chills   suspense is continued and appear lurking and menacing into dining room   hallway   basement and rooms . Great loads of screams   shocks   exploitation and terror abound with the usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the scary entities . It's recreated with magnificent make-up and high grade plethora special effects which are frightening and horrifying the spectator . Based on real events   in fact Lorraine Warren and Andrea Perron served as consultants to director James Wan and the screenwriters   they both claim the movie is accurate to the real story of what happened to the Perrons during the 10 years they lived in the farm house ; as they investigated the Perrons' Rhode Island farmhouse in 1973 and 1974 . The film was given an R rating by the MPAA . The MPAA said simply that the film was so scary that there were no cuts or edits possible that would make it a viable PG-13 film ; the filmmakers did not want to alter the film's tone and accepted the R-rating without any appeals . The movie broke box office records after bringing in a total of $41 million at the box office during its opening weekend . It stands as the third highest grossing opening weekend for an R-rated horror film behind Paranormal Activity 3 (2011) and Hannibal (2001). The Conjuring made a total of $137 million at the box office.

But it doesn't take long before things start to happen; odd sounds and minor things happening around the house. But these quickly escalate into something horrible and the family have to seek out the Warrens to help them investigate into the strange happenings that is taking place in their house.The storyline is nicely composed  quickly establishing solid characters and building up a sense of suspense that quickly turns into dread. The movie does make good use of lighting  environment and shock effects to scare the audience.The poster brandishes ""based upon the true case files of the Warrens""  well  as much as I do believe in the supernatural  these events here were just a bit too out there. But still  it made for some rather good movie entertainment.As for the people hired to play the various roles  then I will say that they all did good jobs with their given characters and roles  and everyone contributed something to their characters and to the movie as a whole.The movie is quick to get into gear and stays in high gear all towards the end. And speaking of the end  I am not particularly fond of those kind of happy Hollywood endings  but hey  it is a crowd pleaser. And the ending is one such that you see coming a mile away - unfortunately.Ultimately  if you like ghost  haunting and possession movies  then ""The Conjuring"" is definitely a movie that you don't want to miss out on  as it is one of the better of this particular genre to have graced the screen in the last couple of years.""The Conjuring"" gets a well-deserved 7 out of 10 rating from me.",positive

Saw was a wholly original shocker  a twisty-turny torture pic well deserving of its success. Insidious breathed new life into the well-worn supernatural genre with its really freaky atmosphere and well-crafted scares. The appeal of the Conjuring  on the other hand  has me puzzled  the film being little more than a collection of generic clichés borrowed from countless other possession movies.Purportedly based on a true story from 1971  The Conjuring stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren  who are called to the home of the Perron family  who have been experiencing terrifying unexplainable occurrences since recently moving into the old house. A little research reveals that the property had once belonged to a witch named Bathsheba  who killed her child and hung herself  putting a curse on anyone who took her land. After lots of creepy phenomena - moving doors  ghostly apparitions  strange noises etc. - wife and mother of five girls  Carolyn Perron  is possessed by the witch and attempts to sacrifice her youngest daughter  at which point the film switches from a lame facsimile of The Amityville Horror/Poltergeist to an equally lame copy of The Exorcist  with the Warrens trying to cast out the evil spirit.Stopping just short of a 360-degree head spin  the film really does offer very little new to fans of the genre  even throwing in a creepy doll called Annabelle for good measure (Annabelle would go on to be the subject of a couple of spin-off movies). I guess if you're new to horror  and haven't seen a lot of similarly themed flicks  The Conjuring would seem like a pretty scary ride  but it left me distinctly unimpressed.4.5 out of 10  rounded up to 5 for IMDb.,negative

Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play the Warrens  here attempting to drive out the demon who's stirring up trouble in the farmhouse of a Rhode Island family in the early 1970s. Lili Taylor has the Linda Blair role here; she gets to spin upside while tied to a chair  vomit up blood through a bed sheet and speak in a guttural voice  ""You're all going to die!""

All too often the setting  scenery and atmosphere are meticulously perfect  but the plot is confusing  full of major holes or even just downright inexistent. Ti West's ""The Innkeepers""  for instance  is such an example of a recent ghost story that is full of suggestive horror tableaux and false scares  like slow moving cameras through the hallways and doors slowly closing by themselves  but eventually it leads absolutely nowhere and the overall film ends up being a disappointment. The last thing anyone could say about ""The Conjuring"" is that it exclusively features suggestive imagery and false scares! Quite the contrary  this is probably the most action-packed and gruesome ghost story ever made. But the thing that makes ""The Conjuring"" a truly great horror accomplishment is that it masterfully combines the gruesome stuff with a powerful plot AND a petrifying atmosphere! The set-up and rudimentary plot is traditional stuff  with a happy family – mum  dad and five daughters no less – moving into a large and isolated countryside mansion where  evidently  a number of horrible events took place in the past. This house doesn't just hold one single dark secret  oh no  it's pretty much a museum of horrors and a hotbed for sinister occurrences! One small piece of advice: if the dog refuses to cross the doorstep  don't even bother to unload the car. Paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren quickly have to come to the rescue  but even they haven't visited such a hopelessly ominous place in all their years of experience. It may sound like a giant cliché  but ""The Conjuring"" is one of the sole movies in its kind that makes you feel uncomfortable the entire time  like there are evil spirits sitting behind you in the theater and breathing down your neck! Like he already demonstrated in ""Insidious"" and the shamefully underrated (in my humble opinion  at least) ""Dead Silence""  director James Wan has a wonderful talent to select the utmost nightmarish scenery  like the creepy doll and the gloomy piano in the cellar. The scares are also professionally timed  highly efficient and accomplished with make-up effects disturbing enough to surprise even die-hard genre freaks. The acting performances are more than adequate  from the adult lead stars as well as from the five young girls. The climax is slightly unsatisfying  but in defense of the film  I also have to admit immediately that it's very difficult to come up with a finale that matches the build-up.",positive

The satisfactory ending touched me so much  and tears flowed on my face uncontrollably  which is very unusual as I was watching a horror film  and not a touching historical epic! What amazes me is that the film does not rely or even require cheap scares such as loud noises or gory scenes. Instead  ""The Conjuring"" builds scariness by suspense and a very good plot. The scary atmosphere is built to and maintained at a very high level  and I had this chest tightness and the generalised unease while watching it.

Free of gore and sex  this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base  but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense  then this delivers plenty to your particular table.Forget the ""based on a true story"" tag  since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age  it's a selling gimmick that actually means ""this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit"". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments  just buy into the premise  commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has  for then the rewards are there for the compliant.Story essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren  who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly  letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen  but again Wan builds it in slow instances  creating a palpable sense of dread  his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.There is no over killing of the boo-jump scares  they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here  strange smells  creaky doors  ominous cellar and etc  yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments  The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.The script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler  itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder  and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid  it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures  both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse  while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga  Patrick Wilson  Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.Met with critical and box office success  The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10",positive

There were many times in here when me (and the audience) jumped or screamed out loud. It builds slowly but it works because you get to know and care about the family. When things DO go overboard at the end it's all the more shocking because you care about the characters. The acting is good across the board. Patrick Wilson and Ron Livingston are OK in their roles but Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor are superb in theirs. There's no nudity  sex or gore but some blood and plenty of scares with loud noises and things suddenly happening. Also the 1970s hairstyles and clothes are frightening too!:) Even though it is scary it goes on just a little bit too long and has its dull moments. I give it a 7.,negative

The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender'  'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.'Split' now replaces 'The Visit' as Shyamalan's best film since 'The Village. Neither were perfect films or were to me the returns to form often touted  both with many great things which made it more frustrating that they also had flaws big enough to stop them from living to full potential. Ranking 'Split' with the rest of the films  it's for me one of his better ones (while 'The Visit' is somewhere in the middle)  not a patch on 'Unbreakable' and especially 'The Sixth Sense' but certainly better than all his previous films post-'The Village' (and that is saying volumes  due to that the least bad of his ""panned"" films 'Lady in the Water' was still poor).The best thing about 'Split' is the performance of James McAvoy  who has never been creepier on film and it is a side that is just startling to watch. He has a very difficult role here  with 20+ very contrasting personalities sometimes having to change without warning quite violently and absolutely nails it in a way that one wouldn't think would expect from him. Anya Taylor Joy is more than up to his level in an enigmatic turn that combines shock  spunk and pathos. As is Betty Buckley in a sympathetic role that she does a lot with.Production design  lighting and effects have a real eeriness that adds hugely to the atmosphere  while the cinematography is significantly better than it was in 'The Visit'  having an audacious and atmospheric professionalism and not done with a technique that will alienate (and has alienated) many. The music is suitably eerie  and Shyamalan does direct more than competently in building on the scares and tension.Apart from an ever so slightly dull beginning  much of the film up to the last half an hour is genuinely scary and suspenseful  with many twisty suspenseful turns  a sense of fun  frightening chills and contortions enough to bend the mind  more than delivering on the horror and psychological thriller elements.However  the last half an hour does disappoint  with a revelation that while certainly not obvious (far from it  actually very much unexpected) is revealed prematurely still which does hurt the momentum and tension  horror and suspense is replaced by head-scratching confusion (in the execution that is because it did feel muddled and under-explained) and behaviours and decisions that will induce groans of frustration. Unfortunately that last personality was as far from realistic or properly scary as one could possibly get (not McAvoy's fault at all  actually he did give the needed creepiness  but what he was given which was goofy)  coming over as pretty silly actually and that jarred.Writing could have been much better  with a better and less awkward flow  the dialogue could have been less clunky and forced as well as less sloppily melodramatic. The victims also were written very lazily  constantly making stupid and illogical decisions that makes one frustrated at them rather than rooting for them.On the whole  fairly split here. A lot of great merits but could have been better. Still one of Shyamalan's better films  just not enough to make me proclaim ""he's back!"" 6/10 Bethany Cox",positive

The story is about a killer with multiple personalities and the best thing about it is James McAvoy who does a great job with a very difficult role.

M. Night Shyamalan's SPLIT is certainly a very interesting movie that clearly seems to have been inspired by the various Brian De Palma thrillers that he directed throughout his career.

James McAvoy really gets to shine in this film as you'd expect since he plays so many different characters. I'm not going to spoil all of the personalities but it was really amazing getting to see a talented actor play a chess match and come up with the various different personalities and bringing little touches to each of them. There are a few scenes where the actor is forced to go from one character to another in the matter of seconds and he perfectly nails it. There's no question that he brings a wide range of emotions as there are times where you feel bad for him and other times where he's downright creepy to say the least. All of the supporting cast are good but Ana Taylor Joy deserves a special mention.The screenplay most takes place inside this unknown location where we see the three girls being stalked by one personality after another. The film exits the location a couple times including introducing us to the man's doctor who is trying to control the personalities as well as some flashback scenes dealing with the main girl's childhood. It's here where I think the film makes it's biggest mistake. I don't mind anything that's in the actual film but it ends up running at a 118-minutes and I thought this was a bit too long and slow. I think everything in the film could have worked much better with a faster pace and perhaps a tighter editing job.With that said  there's no question that SPLIT holds your attention throughout and yes  there's that ending  which I certainly won't spoil here but I found it to be excellent. It's great that Shyamalan is back and doing such fine work and I really can't wait to see what he does next.,positive

McAvoy has the showy acting and he delivers. Anya Taylor-Joy does most of her work with her stone-face and those eyes. There is a nice sequence with a coat-hanger. I wonder if there is more tension to be had. M. Night keeps most of the violence off camera. I would definitely change the number 23 to something more manageable. Six would be more compelling as the audience counts up each identity. This is a solid addition to the M. Night library.,positive

The girls do plot to escape but get caught  they discover that Kevin has multiple personalities although only a few tend to emerge more regularly. However Kevin seems to be on the verge of the creation of a more beastlier manifestation.One of the kidnapped girl's Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) seems to be more competent with her survivalist instincts due to how she was bought up which we find out in flashbacks. Meanwhile Kevin has been in the care of a renowned psychiatrist who seems to be concerned about him and investigates further.Shyamalan hints at a universe shown in his previous film Unbreakable  where a person could elevate to a different level of being. He is helped by a stellar performance by McAvoy who does struggle to show all 23 personalities.In its heart though it is still 'girls that are kidnapped and held in a dungeon film' and frankly they tend to be two a penny in any given month. Despite the split personality gimmick the film was not that innovative or interesting and derivative of films like Silence of the Lambs.,positive

Casey  who has been abused by her Uncle John (Brad William Henke) since she was a kid  tries to manipulate the weakest personalities to escape. But the problem is that the strong personality The Beast is quite unleashed and is coming. ""Split"" is another annoying and silly film by the mediocre and overrated M. Night Shyamalan. This director / writer made success with the rip-off of ""Haunted"" (1995) and now uses the concept of the masterpiece ""Identity"" (2003) to make ""Split"". James McAvoy's character is not scary but laughable and ridiculous. The psychologist is absolutely incompetent and only Casey Cooke is a promising character wasted by the terrible screenplay. The conclusion is maybe the worst part of this forgettable film. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Fragmentado"" (""Shattered"")",negative

The film opens with a creepy setup  and gradually plays out the multiple personalities of the main characters  while at the same time increasing the tension through the peril of the young women trapped somewhere. In terms of stakes and tension  it mostly does it well  with an escalation as the film goes  but the film is not tight enough to be event driven  and at two hours there is lots of material which seemed intended to do something  but mostly doesn't deliver.It is an odd film in this way  because there is a lot here to work with  but too much of it is superficial. It plays very much like a first or second draft; so for example there are elements so undercooked that it feels like the type of material that would have been taken out later down the road to try to make more space for other elements  or just recognizing that it adds time but not value. Casey's flashbacks add almost nothing - not because they are a bad idea  but because they are not worked through enough; the film would have lost almost nothing by removing them. Likewise  the battle within the main character doesn't have a sense of struggle really; it could have been much more  and thus the conclusion could have been more impacting  but it doesn't have much in the way of weight or emotion behind it. Again  there was much more writing and refining to be done here.It is a shame  because the cast deserve more than they have to work with. McAvoy is great as he slips between characters totally convincingly; he throws himself into this and almost singlehandedly makes the film worth seeing. Taylor-Joy is almost as good because of how she plays her fear; while the film doesn't help the viewer connect to her 5-year old self  the actresses seems to have found it  and there is more in her performance than the film lets us see. Probably the blame should be laid at the feet of Shyamalan; he wrote and directed this  and it is very his type of weakness - he wants the concept and idea to be the thing  but the depth etc he is not often able to find. The film running long and having too much in it is probably down to him too - editor Ciarrocchi seems to have his career thanks to Shyamalan  so he is unlikely to be tough in the edit.Split squanders a lot - a couple of very good performances  and a generally interesting concept and through-line mostly. It lays out its plot in semi-cooked chunks and then serves them up like an early draft - some of it needed chucking  and the rest needed improving; but it doesn't do either.,negative

Of course Split refers to our main character. Although M. Night has had some diverse reactions on his last outputs. But mostly people did like this and it almost seems like he made a comeback. If you thought he vanished that is of course. The script is tight and the movie has a lot of memorable moments (most of them being weird)  although one of the biggest can be seen in the trailer  which is unfortunate.There's also another scene where M.Night can be seen. His Hitchcock moment as some call it (I think he himself too). Letthis argument not spoil the fun you may be having with this one. The overall acting is good (apart from the one cameo I just mentioned  which is cringe-worthy) and the tension is there until the end.

Night Shyamalan's films  in that I felt his best efforts  ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable""  came early in his career and he's struggled to match the intensity and credibility of those pictures. ""Split""  I think  gets him back on the right track with a psychological thriller that contains elements of horror  not so much for what you see on screen  but what your imagination suggests might be terrifying. I thought James McAvoy did a commendable job in a role calling for a split personality with multiple characters. I also thought the picture cleverly included a back story for the character of Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy)  who was able to relate to the 'Hedwig' portion of Kevin Wendell's (McAvoy) psyche by virtue of being an abuse victim herself. The only thing I get frustrated about in stories like this is when the main protagonist is outnumbered  and the 'victims' can't or won't come to an understanding that they could take him out if they joined forces. Now maybe the 'Barry' facet of Wendell's alter-ego might have been too strong to overcome  but the 'Dennis' or 'Patricia' personalities might have succumbed to a three on one attack. Easy enough for me to say because I've never been in that position  and each of the kidnapped girls individually were too traumatized to take direct action initially. Then once they were separated  the 'gang up' option went away. The final scene of Bruce Willis reprising his character David Dunn from ""Unbreakable"" was a neat way to whet the appetite of Shyamalan fans who would never have expected a follow up to that earlier film  and I for one will be on hand to see if ""Glass"" restores some of the magic of that masterful film. My only other comment is reserved for Betty Buckley portraying the sympathetic psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher  who's painstaking patience in attempting to reconcile Wendell's twenty three personalities ultimately ended in tragedy. Wisely  the story didn't try to account for all of them  and in Dr. Fletcher's case  it appeared that eight was enough.",positive

""Split"" turns out to be a pretty interesting movie  as James McAvoy's character - suffering from dissociative personality disorder - holds three teenage girls hostage and they meet his multiple personalities.I'm not a psychologist  so I can neither confirm nor refute the movie's depiction of the main character.

Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense  Signs) has had a string of failures  including The Village  The Happening and The Last Airbender  I heard the reviews and saw the clips for this new film  it seemed worth a go. Basically  three teenagers  Claire (Haley Lu Richardson)  Marcia (Jessica Sula) and outsider Casey (Atlantis's Anya Taylor-Joy) are kidnapped by a man  who they later realise has more than one personality  in fact he inhabits twenty-three. The kidnapper  Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) was a victim of abuse during childhood  he has severe dissociative identity disorder. Kevin's personalities include ""Dennis"" who is a control freak and has obsessive-compulsive disorder  ""Barry"" who is an artistic fashion designer and the dominant personality  ""Patricia"" who is an assuring prissy woman  and ""Hedwig"" who is a vulnerable nine-year- old boy. While the kidnapped girls try to find a way out  including manipulating the various personalities to escape  Kevin in his other guises often visits his psychiatrist  Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley)  who believes some of his personalities can manifest unique physical attributes for each personality. As ""Dennis"" and ""Patricia""  Kevin warns the girls that they will sacrificed to ""The Beast""  the twenty-fourth personality waiting to be unleashed  he also talks about the possibility of this ""real"" personality emerging with Dr. Fletcher  who is trying to understand the reason for his disorder. While this is all going  the film goes into flashback to see five-year-old Casey (Izzie Leigh Coffey) and her own traumatic childhood  who suffered the death of her father (Sebastian Arcelus)  and was molested by her uncle John (Brad William Henke)  who became her legal guardian  she completed shooting him with a rifle  but hesitated. Eventually Dr. Fletcher slowly realises something is wrong and that Kevin is hiding something  and Kevin meanwhile does bring out the feared personality ""The Beast""  capable of superhuman levels of strength  speed  mobility and the hunger for human flesh. Marcia and Claire are killed by ""The Beast""  but Casey manages to escape  it turns out they were trapped underneath Philadelphia Zoo  where Kevin lives and works  ""Dennis""  ""Patricia"" and ""Hedwig"" exert permanent control of Kevin's body. In the end  the news of Kevin's crimes is reported on the news  he is nicknamed ""The Horde""  someone in a diner watching remarks that it reminds them of a wheelchair-bound terrorist from 15 years ago  an older David Dunn (Bruce Willis) tells them it was ""Mr. Glass""  this is a twist ending revealing it is a sequel to Unbreakable  ""The Horde"" is supposed to be another villain of Dunn's story. Also starring James McAvoy ""Barry"" / ""Orwell"" / ""Jade""  Neal Huff as Mr. Benoit and M. Night Shyamalan as Jai  Hooters Lover. McAvoy demonstrates his splendid acting ability as the lunatic kidnapper with the severe personality disorder  he is both chilling and at times amusing  the supporting characters never know which personality they are dealing with  it is creepy almost all the way through  and it is a good twist to the kidnap scenario movie  but the flashbacks are pointless  and the ""twist"" ending is nothing that memorable  the film as a whole is so-so  an average psychological horror-like thriller.

Night Shyamalan's Split is essentially one long 'set-up' movie  introducing us to the many personalities of disassociative identity disorder patient Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy)  as well as teen-in peril Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy)  both of whom play a part in the director's forthcoming Unbreakable sequel Glass.As such  the film feels a little inconclusive  but still manages to be fully engrossing thanks to a standout performance from McAvoy  who brilliantly handles his character's many personalities  and a likeable turn from Taylor-Joy  who plays one of three teenage girls abducted by Crumb as food for his burgeoning twenty-fourth identity  the Beast.The film is a bit head-scratching at times  but Shyamalan pulls it all together nicely for a rousing finale  and tops it off with a surprising end credits scene guaranteed to leave fans of Unbreakable champing at the bit for the next instalment in what is becoming a delightfully unorthodox superhero series.,positive

Night Shyamalan's ""Split""  which he wrote and directed (both rather clinically)  opens with a distinct ""Silence of the Lambs"" vibe before eventually evolving into a continuation of themes Shyamalan used for his ""Unbreakable"". Three teenage girls in Philadelphia are abducted from a parking lot by a man with dissociative identity disorder; he harbors dozens of personalities--male  female and child--but the final one to present itself is calling for an alliance of ""the horde""  and may represent something superhuman. While the opening scenes do have a familiar ring  they are well-executed by the filmmaker  who gives the audience what its probably hoping for; but Shyamalan  to his credit (although some genre buffs might not be so generous)  is aiming for something loftier than imprisoned girls attempting to escape from a psychotic. The film offers a dissertation on DID via the captor's somewhat-unwitting psychiatrist  who--via Skype!--gives a clinical rundown of the mental disorder to her colleagues (including case studies). None of this information  however interesting  is utilized in the final stretch  as Shyamalan is out to baffle us with a plot-twist that is both confounding and amusing. While ""Split"" is creepy on occasion  it isn't effective as a scary thriller. Maybe Shyamalan feels he's above giving his audience a shock  a jolt  but sometimes a few good clichés are better than a round-table discussion. ** from ****",negative

As several reviewers have already written Night Shyamalan  who started out so well  in fact ""Unbreakable"" is one of my favorite movies  made some real stinkers after a few early hits. So ""Split"" is a return to form  sort of. I didn't count the number of personalities  they say it is 23  but James McAvoy is really  really good as the several distinctly different split personalities. As the movie begins one dad is giving a ride home for his daughter and two friends and  as he finishes loading the trunk of the car someone comes up  drugs him  and drives away with the three girls. It is one of those many personalities.I liked the first 20 minutes or so  and I liked the last 20 minutes or so. The vast hour+ middle has a lot of talking  either the abductor with his psychiatrist or the abductor with his captives. Some things do happen but the great middle of the movie moves very deliberately.Who would really like this movie? Those who like a good character study above all. Shyamalan likes ""twists"" and there are some but mostly unnecessary to the core story of a man fighting with his demons and three young girls trying to regain their freedom.I particularly enjoyed the young actress Anya Taylor-Joy as one of the girls  Casey. Not so much for her acting  which was fine  but she has these wide-set eyes and lips so perfect that they look like they were carved by an artist. Just a totally unique look.Plus I am a fan of Haley Lu Richardson who was one of the girls  Claire. I have seen her in several movies and she is simply a very good actress.SPOILERS: In the end we find that the girls had been held in an underground maintenance area in the Philadelphia zoo  someone found them and the survivors were freed.",negative

It's certainly never boring  but...,27-Jan-17,"Split is a film that asks you to suspend your disbelief  and at first  even after the many films that this director has done where he goes way too far  I was with Split for about the first half of the way through  or maybe more. I knew logically this is not how DID works (Disassociative Identity Disorder)  but hey  it's a movie  let's go with it. And to Shyamalan's credit  he casts the two major parts to the point where it's key and it works. And as a director  overall  and in large part thanks to the cinematographer behind It Follows  it's a film directed with real terror and suspense. It's low-budget  largely a 'bottle' film  and he uses his money with true style. It's paced well... where was I (now I feel like I got this disorder and will become two different critics here  gotta control...)Oh  yeah  James McAvoy  he's fantastic. He may not be playing 23 personalities in total  but the ones that Shyamalan focuses on are developed enough - among them is Barry (a gay fashion designer that McAvoy sort of plays like a young Pacino or something  in the physicality)  Dennis (the one who may seem to be in 'control' and is extremely OCD about any dirt) and Hedwig (who is nine years old  and you can tell) - give McAvoy enough room to explore these personalities. There's times of awkward laughter at first  but this gives way to seeing that McAvoy is so committed to these characters  and is pulling them all of with intensity and charm and disbelief and a madness that is kind of similar to them all  that he's impossible to dislike.Another key player is Ana Taylor Joy  as she's the one of the three girls that we get to know the most (though with this we get into something of a  for me  forced motivation  but I'll get to that later)  and she is on for all of these interactions with McAvoy. She's the one who can somehow speak to Hedwig sympathetically and connect with him  and when she is freaking out and trying to hold things inside  she does this perfectly. Between this and The VVitch she is really on a roll as a major actress for thrillers - she can play terrified  but being in control and being bad-ass works as well. And for a lot of the scenes the actress playing the psychiatrist  Betty Buckley  is believable  as far as she can take the lines to...Okay  here's where we get into the DID here with this movie in reality  it's with its writer AND then also its director. I don't mean the same person  I mean they are separate entities. Shyamalan the director is on top of his game here  with a formal rigor that hasn't clicked this week in well over a decade (it may even connect to Unbreakable  which... oh  more on that at the end of this). Shyamalan the *writer* is something else. He's still someone who thinks he's oh  so  so clever  and you know what? For that first half or so  he kind of is. At least  again  when it comes to the suspension-of-disbelief factor. He does a more than competent job of giving us a believable enough set-up with these girls being held captive  Barry putting up his false front when emailing but then denying anything is wrong to the doctor  and then how the personalities have their splits with the girls and how they are trying (unsuccessfully to escape)... but then Shyamalan the writer gets greedy. Or insane. Or both.The biggest problem here is that this man is CHEATING by the end of this  and in a way that is baffling. He can't have enough with having this somewhat preposterous thriller about a man juggling all these personalities that may lead up to ""The Beast""  the 24th personality. No  it needs to be deeper than that. It also needs to involve child molestation - not just with this man  but the Ana Taylor Joy character when she was younger - and that this  uh  maybe leads into having these super DID powers(!?) He's creating a whacked-out mythology where one needn't exist  and by the time the third act takes off  and you can mark it as soon as the Buckley character comes to Barry/Dennis/Hedwig/Patricia/Et-Al's basement dwelling  it fully goes into bananas territory.I know  I know  it's a thriller  I know I should keep buying into what this is selling... but I just couldn't. Most of all (oh  hell  you got this far in this review) it's the gall to turn this around to make this as part of a  uh  Shyamalan Cinematic Universe with a Bruce Willis Unbreakable cameo that brings me into the 'you're cheating!' territory. Perhaps this is simply this man's M.O. as far as crafting his material  that he can see ahead and know that this is what he has to do  and that everything ties together... or he wrote himself into a corner  realized he was writing sheer insanity as far as where McAvoy goes in this final third  and had to cover up. Either way  it might work for you... or it may feel like him f***ing with all of us. At any rate  all of the material with The Beast has the sensation of Shyamalan as mad mainstream provocateur  like 'hey  how far can I actually take this stuff  you've come this far right  eh  right? RIGHT?!' To his credit  this is a more enjoyable piece of madness than The Village  and its final third makes it something I want to revisit simply to show friends in a 'Look upon this wonder in awe' way like The Happening. I think among the Shyamalan *bad* movies  and this is bad make no mistake  it's directed like a pro and the actors are all on their game  and becomes the best of them.",positive

Here I am  stuck in the middle with the 23 of you,10-Jan-20,"I completely gave up on M. Night Shyamalan between 2005 and 2015. Talking in film titles  that means between ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Visit"". I always thought his supposedly greatest accomplishments ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were vastly overrated (and even blatant rip-offs of obscure horror gems)  but at least they were watchable. I severely disliked ""Signs"" and absolutely hated ""The Village""  so after that it was exit M. Night for me. From what I read on the internet  he only made rubbish and commercial flops in this 10-year-period anyway. ""Split"" seemed different. It has a more intriguing concept than all of Shyamalan's previous movies combined  and for the very first time  the plot genuinely appeals to fans of dark psycho-thrillers. Usually his stories are balancing on the verge of fantasy and melodrama  with a minor touch of morbidity.The first half of ""Split"" is really good! The script luckily doesn't waste too much time and almost immediately begins with the powerful and intense kidnapping sequence of three teenage girls - in broad daylight on a busy parking lot - by a sinister young man with an evil grimace on his face. The girls  two typically shallow beauties and one introvert girl with a troubled past  are taken to an unknown location and locked up in a sort of basement. What follows next are a good 40-45 minutes of terrific cinema during which the three girls  simultaneously with the audience  gradually learn that their kidnapper isn't just an ordinary maniac but a deeply disturbed schizophrenic with no less than 23 different personalities. The quiet girl  Casey  realizes their only chance for escape is by manipulating the weaker personalities  but there's also a 24th and ultimately evil alter ego brooding within Kevin.Lots of praise and respect for talented young actress Anya Taylor-Joy  and especially for James McAvoy as Barry  Kevin  Dennis  Hedwig  Patricia  etc. Okay  admittedly  it must be a dream come true for any actor to be offered the chance to play a character like this and demonstrate that you are capable of depicting a variety of roles  but still McAvoy puts a lot of passion and devotion in every single twisted personality! My personal favorite is definitely the posh  elderly lady with the dress and necklace. Best male-actor-playing-ugly-old-woman since Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire""  for sure! Sadly  M. Night's true personality also comes to the surface  and not even McAvoy can prevent ""Split"" from slowly turning into a dull and overly talkative B-thriller. Notably the conversations between whatever personality and his therapist are tedious and seem to last endlessly  but also Casey's cliched background story is quite redundant. Not sure what rating ""Split"" received  but the violence and murders all occur off screen  and that is a damn shame! I didn't like the ending (come to think of it  I never like the endings in Shyamalan's movies) but apparently it's the bridge towards a sequel/origin story ""Glass"".",positive

Always proving to be a most divisive director/writer/actor  Shyamalan has returned to the sort of noticeable form that had him earmarked in his early days as a director to follow - with the proviso that inevitably this is going to still infuriate some for its handling of the subjects at hand.The plot trajectory is simple enough  girls kidnapped by a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder  as the girls in fear try to escape  a number of his personalities put in an appearance. Which builds up to the finale  which explodes after following on from the suspense and dread atmospherics so beloved by the director. In the mix joining the mental health issue with our main protagonist is a good meaning doctor (naturally)  and the spectre of child abuse rears its ugly head. So not a movie to be cheered up by then! While if looking for a detailed and attentive look at the mental health issues to hand you will be disappointed.However  there is a style to the picture in how it draws you into the predicament of the main players  boosted no end by McAvoy on irresistible form. Given licence to chew every scene  he delivers his various characters with great relish and no little amount of skill. Props to for Taylor-Joy  who as the lead kidnappee has deftly blended youthful innocence with resourceful strength (aided by Shyamalan's writing of course). Conversely  Shyamalan is guilty of just making a pic for entertainment purpose  which works as it's a very good creepy thriller with its black humour moments  but the mental health plot devices ensure his gimmicks will not be welcomed by all. 7/10,positive

The other is to keep the horrors mainly psychological and understated and hope the actor playing the psycho isn't going to have too much fun in the role The good news is that SPLIT isn't torture porn . Even better news is while James McAvoy has fun in the role it's never enough to actually take you out of the movie . McAvoy is of course a Scottish actor from a working class background and it's usually a distraction watching ""one of us"" in a commercial Hollywood movie but here McAvoy delivers a pivotal role playing a character suffering from dissociative identity disorder . Okay it's obvious no one had an eye on the Oscars when this was released and McAvoy's character pieces are a bit episodic along with being intermittently camp but even so the film rests mainly on this performance !!!! TAKE NO CHANCES SUGGESTIVE SPOILER !!!!! M Night Shyamalan is a director whose string of flops over the last few years have made the average audience member totally forget that he was once being touted as the new Spielberg and the temptation to do a sequel to one of his earlier regarded works must have been huge . Instead he concentrates on the understated psychological horrors of the predator and his prey in a slightly above average thriller .

The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender'  'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.'Split' now replaces 'The Visit' as Shyamalan's best film since 'The Village. Neither were perfect films or were to me the returns to form often touted  both with many great things which made it more frustrating that they also had flaws big enough to stop them from living to full potential. Ranking 'Split' with the rest of the films  it's for me one of his better ones (while 'The Visit' is somewhere in the middle)  not a patch on 'Unbreakable' and especially 'The Sixth Sense' but certainly better than all his previous films post-'The Village' (and that is saying volumes  due to that the least bad of his ""panned"" films 'Lady in the Water' was still poor).The best thing about 'Split' is the performance of James McAvoy  who has never been creepier on film and it is a side that is just startling to watch. He has a very difficult role here  with 20+ very contrasting personalities sometimes having to change without warning quite violently and absolutely nails it in a way that one wouldn't think would expect from him. Anya Taylor Joy is more than up to his level in an enigmatic turn that combines shock  spunk and pathos. As is Betty Buckley in a sympathetic role that she does a lot with.Production design  lighting and effects have a real eeriness that adds hugely to the atmosphere  while the cinematography is significantly better than it was in 'The Visit'  having an audacious and atmospheric professionalism and not done with a technique that will alienate (and has alienated) many. The music is suitably eerie  and Shyamalan does direct more than competently in building on the scares and tension.Apart from an ever so slightly dull beginning  much of the film up to the last half an hour is genuinely scary and suspenseful  with many twisty suspenseful turns  a sense of fun  frightening chills and contortions enough to bend the mind  more than delivering on the horror and psychological thriller elements.However  the last half an hour does disappoint  with a revelation that while certainly not obvious (far from it  actually very much unexpected) is revealed prematurely still which does hurt the momentum and tension  horror and suspense is replaced by head-scratching confusion (in the execution that is because it did feel muddled and under-explained) and behaviours and decisions that will induce groans of frustration. Unfortunately that last personality was as far from realistic or properly scary as one could possibly get (not McAvoy's fault at all  actually he did give the needed creepiness  but what he was given which was goofy)  coming over as pretty silly actually and that jarred.Writing could have been much better  with a better and less awkward flow  the dialogue could have been less clunky and forced as well as less sloppily melodramatic. The victims also were written very lazily  constantly making stupid and illogical decisions that makes one frustrated at them rather than rooting for them.On the whole  fairly split here. A lot of great merits but could have been better. Still one of Shyamalan's better films  just not enough to make me proclaim ""he's back!"" 6/10 Bethany Cox",positive

Films like THE HAPPENING and THE LAST AIRBENDER have diluted his stock in Hollywood and made him a laughing stock in some circles  so it's a relief to see that he's getting back on track with SPLIT.Not that this is a perfect film; I found it one that takes a little while to build up steam although once it gets going it really hits home. The story is about a killer with multiple personalities and the best thing about it is James McAvoy who does a great job with a very difficult role. The rest of the cast aren't so impressive  and the script at times feels more than a little pretentious  but overall this is low key and impressive  building to some startling moments  and a definite step in the right direction for a one-time Hollywood great.,positive

M. Night Shyamalan's SPLIT is certainly a very interesting movie that clearly seems to have been inspired by the various Brian De Palma thrillers that he directed throughout his career. I had a couple major issues with the film but there's still no doubt that the director-writer is back on top of his game in this well-made and at times tense thriller.What I enjoyed most about the film should come as no surprise. James McAvoy really gets to shine in this film as you'd expect since he plays so many different characters. I'm not going to spoil all of the personalities but it was really amazing getting to see a talented actor play a chess match and come up with the various different personalities and bringing little touches to each of them. There are a few scenes where the actor is forced to go from one character to another in the matter of seconds and he perfectly nails it. There's no question that he brings a wide range of emotions as there are times where you feel bad for him and other times where he's downright creepy to say the least. All of the supporting cast are good but Ana Taylor Joy deserves a special mention.The screenplay most takes place inside this unknown location where we see the three girls being stalked by one personality after another. The film exits the location a couple times including introducing us to the man's doctor who is trying to control the personalities as well as some flashback scenes dealing with the main girl's childhood. It's here where I think the film makes it's biggest mistake. I don't mind anything that's in the actual film but it ends up running at a 118-minutes and I thought this was a bit too long and slow. I think everything in the film could have worked much better with a faster pace and perhaps a tighter editing job.With that said  there's no question that SPLIT holds your attention throughout and yes  there's that ending  which I certainly won't spoil here but I found it to be excellent. It's great that Shyamalan is back and doing such fine work and I really can't wait to see what he does next.,positive

McAvoy has the showy acting and he delivers. Anya Taylor-Joy does most of her work with her stone-face and those eyes. There is a nice sequence with a coat-hanger. I wonder if there is more tension to be had. M. Night keeps most of the violence off camera. I would definitely change the number 23 to something more manageable. Six would be more compelling as the audience counts up each identity. This is a solid addition to the M. Night library.,positive

The girls do plot to escape but get caught  they discover that Kevin has multiple personalities although only a few tend to emerge more regularly. However Kevin seems to be on the verge of the creation of a more beastlier manifestation.One of the kidnapped girl's Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) seems to be more competent with her survivalist instincts due to how she was bought up which we find out in flashbacks. Meanwhile Kevin has been in the care of a renowned psychiatrist who seems to be concerned about him and investigates further.Shyamalan hints at a universe shown in his previous film Unbreakable  where a person could elevate to a different level of being. He is helped by a stellar performance by McAvoy who does struggle to show all 23 personalities.In its heart though it is still 'girls that are kidnapped and held in a dungeon film' and frankly they tend to be two a penny in any given month. Despite the split personality gimmick the film was not that innovative or interesting and derivative of films like Silence of the Lambs.,positive

Casey  who has been abused by her Uncle John (Brad William Henke) since she was a kid  tries to manipulate the weakest personalities to escape. But the problem is that the strong personality The Beast is quite unleashed and is coming. ""Split"" is another annoying and silly film by the mediocre and overrated M. Night Shyamalan. This director / writer made success with the rip-off of ""Haunted"" (1995) and now uses the concept of the masterpiece ""Identity"" (2003) to make ""Split"". James McAvoy's character is not scary but laughable and ridiculous. The psychologist is absolutely incompetent and only Casey Cooke is a promising character wasted by the terrible screenplay. The conclusion is maybe the worst part of this forgettable film. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Fragmentado"" (""Shattered"")",negative

The film opens with a creepy setup  and gradually plays out the multiple personalities of the main characters  while at the same time increasing the tension through the peril of the young women trapped somewhere. In terms of stakes and tension  it mostly does it well  with an escalation as the film goes  but the film is not tight enough to be event driven  and at two hours there is lots of material which seemed intended to do something  but mostly doesn't deliver.It is an odd film in this way  because there is a lot here to work with  but too much of it is superficial. It plays very much like a first or second draft; so for example there are elements so undercooked that it feels like the type of material that would have been taken out later down the road to try to make more space for other elements  or just recognizing that it adds time but not value. Casey's flashbacks add almost nothing - not because they are a bad idea  but because they are not worked through enough; the film would have lost almost nothing by removing them. Likewise  the battle within the main character doesn't have a sense of struggle really; it could have been much more  and thus the conclusion could have been more impacting  but it doesn't have much in the way of weight or emotion behind it. Again  there was much more writing and refining to be done here.It is a shame  because the cast deserve more than they have to work with. McAvoy is great as he slips between characters totally convincingly; he throws himself into this and almost singlehandedly makes the film worth seeing. Taylor-Joy is almost as good because of how she plays her fear; while the film doesn't help the viewer connect to her 5-year old self  the actresses seems to have found it  and there is more in her performance than the film lets us see. Probably the blame should be laid at the feet of Shyamalan; he wrote and directed this  and it is very his type of weakness - he wants the concept and idea to be the thing  but the depth etc he is not often able to find. The film running long and having too much in it is probably down to him too - editor Ciarrocchi seems to have his career thanks to Shyamalan  so he is unlikely to be tough in the edit.Split squanders a lot - a couple of very good performances  and a generally interesting concept and through-line mostly. It lays out its plot in semi-cooked chunks and then serves them up like an early draft - some of it needed chucking  and the rest needed improving; but it doesn't do either.,negative

Of course Split refers to our main character. Although M. Night has had some diverse reactions on his last outputs. But mostly people did like this and it almost seems like he made a comeback. If you thought he vanished that is of course. The script is tight and the movie has a lot of memorable moments (most of them being weird)  although one of the biggest can be seen in the trailer  which is unfortunate.There's also another scene where M.Night can be seen. His Hitchcock moment as some call it (I think he himself too). Letthis argument not spoil the fun you may be having with this one. The overall acting is good (apart from the one cameo I just mentioned  which is cringe-worthy) and the tension is there until the end.

Night Shyamalan's films  in that I felt his best efforts  ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable""  came early in his career and he's struggled to match the intensity and credibility of those pictures. ""Split""  I think  gets him back on the right track with a psychological thriller that contains elements of horror  not so much for what you see on screen  but what your imagination suggests might be terrifying. I thought James McAvoy did a commendable job in a role calling for a split personality with multiple characters. I also thought the picture cleverly included a back story for the character of Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy)  who was able to relate to the 'Hedwig' portion of Kevin Wendell's (McAvoy) psyche by virtue of being an abuse victim herself. The only thing I get frustrated about in stories like this is when the main protagonist is outnumbered  and the 'victims' can't or won't come to an understanding that they could take him out if they joined forces. Now maybe the 'Barry' facet of Wendell's alter-ego might have been too strong to overcome  but the 'Dennis' or 'Patricia' personalities might have succumbed to a three on one attack. Easy enough for me to say because I've never been in that position  and each of the kidnapped girls individually were too traumatized to take direct action initially. Then once they were separated  the 'gang up' option went away. The final scene of Bruce Willis reprising his character David Dunn from ""Unbreakable"" was a neat way to whet the appetite of Shyamalan fans who would never have expected a follow up to that earlier film  and I for one will be on hand to see if ""Glass"" restores some of the magic of that masterful film. My only other comment is reserved for Betty Buckley portraying the sympathetic psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher  who's painstaking patience in attempting to reconcile Wendell's twenty three personalities ultimately ended in tragedy. Wisely  the story didn't try to account for all of them  and in Dr. Fletcher's case  it appeared that eight was enough.",positive

""Split"" turns out to be a pretty interesting movie  as James McAvoy's character - suffering from dissociative personality disorder - holds three teenage girls hostage and they meet his multiple personalities.I'm not a psychologist  so I can neither confirm nor refute the movie's depiction of the main character. But I did like what the psychologist (Betty Buckley  who played the gym teacher in the original ""Carrie"") said. I wonder if this will interest more people in the topic.

Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense  Signs) has had a string of failures  including The Village  The Happening and The Last Airbender  I heard the reviews and saw the clips for this new film  it seemed worth a go. Basically  three teenagers  Claire (Haley Lu Richardson)  Marcia (Jessica Sula) and outsider Casey (Atlantis's Anya Taylor-Joy) are kidnapped by a man  who they later realise has more than one personality  in fact he inhabits twenty-three. The kidnapper  Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) was a victim of abuse during childhood  he has severe dissociative identity disorder. Kevin's personalities include ""Dennis"" who is a control freak and has obsessive-compulsive disorder  ""Barry"" who is an artistic fashion designer and the dominant personality  ""Patricia"" who is an assuring prissy woman  and ""Hedwig"" who is a vulnerable nine-year- old boy. While the kidnapped girls try to find a way out  including manipulating the various personalities to escape  Kevin in his other guises often visits his psychiatrist  Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley)  who believes some of his personalities can manifest unique physical attributes for each personality. As ""Dennis"" and ""Patricia""  Kevin warns the girls that they will sacrificed to ""The Beast""  the twenty-fourth personality waiting to be unleashed  he also talks about the possibility of this ""real"" personality emerging with Dr. Fletcher  who is trying to understand the reason for his disorder. While this is all going  the film goes into flashback to see five-year-old Casey (Izzie Leigh Coffey) and her own traumatic childhood  who suffered the death of her father (Sebastian Arcelus)  and was molested by her uncle John (Brad William Henke)  who became her legal guardian  she completed shooting him with a rifle  but hesitated. Eventually Dr. Fletcher slowly realises something is wrong and that Kevin is hiding something  and Kevin meanwhile does bring out the feared personality ""The Beast""  capable of superhuman levels of strength  speed  mobility and the hunger for human flesh. Marcia and Claire are killed by ""The Beast""  but Casey manages to escape  it turns out they were trapped underneath Philadelphia Zoo  where Kevin lives and works  ""Dennis""  ""Patricia"" and ""Hedwig"" exert permanent control of Kevin's body. In the end  the news of Kevin's crimes is reported on the news  he is nicknamed ""The Horde""  someone in a diner watching remarks that it reminds them of a wheelchair-bound terrorist from 15 years ago  an older David Dunn (Bruce Willis) tells them it was ""Mr. Glass""  this is a twist ending revealing it is a sequel to Unbreakable  ""The Horde"" is supposed to be another villain of Dunn's story. Also starring James McAvoy ""Barry"" / ""Orwell"" / ""Jade""  Neal Huff as Mr. Benoit and M. Night Shyamalan as Jai  Hooters Lover. McAvoy demonstrates his splendid acting ability as the lunatic kidnapper with the severe personality disorder  he is both chilling and at times amusing  the supporting characters never know which personality they are dealing with  it is creepy almost all the way through  and it is a good twist to the kidnap scenario movie  but the flashbacks are pointless  and the ""twist"" ending is nothing that memorable  the film as a whole is so-so  an average psychological horror-like thriller.

Night is an avid comic books fan   which was made in this film that along with ""Unbreakable""   and ""Glass"" belong to a top-notch trilogy starred by Bruce Willis   Samuel L Jackson and James McAvoy. Well produced by Night Shyamalan himself   many of his films involve pivotal roles with extraordinary abilities or events happening to them and with children always having family problems .

Night Shyamalan had gotten  I must admit that I was looking forward to getting to watch it and was hoping that this would indeed be a step up from the usual messy movies that he directs.And while ""Split"" starts out great enough  it quickly becomes apparent that this is just yet another story befuddled by his directorial skills. Sure  the movie had some great moments  but the storyline was just too predictable  and when the main character started to climb on the wall and ceiling I was just about ready to turn off the movie and find something else to watch.It should be said that this movie is watchable and enjoyable only because of the interesting and diverse performance that James McAvoy puts on as he portrays multiple personalities trapped within the same body.""Split"" is about as predictable as they come  and you got it figured out not way too far into the movie  and the storyline was suffering from that face  as if being relatively weak in storyline wasn't enough.All in all  James McAvoy carries this movie and makes it worth watching. However  ""Split"" is not an oustanding movie from director M. Night Shyamalan. The movie does have fans  that much is clear from the high rating. However  personally  I found it to be just a mediocre movie  and I wasn't impressed with it aside from James McAvoy.",negative

Night Shyamalan's Split is essentially one long 'set-up' movie  introducing us to the many personalities of disassociative identity disorder patient Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy)  as well as teen-in peril Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy)  both of whom play a part in the director's forthcoming Unbreakable sequel Glass.As such  the film feels a little inconclusive  but still manages to be fully engrossing thanks to a standout performance from McAvoy  who brilliantly handles his character's many personalities  and a likeable turn from Taylor-Joy  who plays one of three teenage girls abducted by Crumb as food for his burgeoning twenty-fourth identity  the Beast.The film is a bit head-scratching at times  but Shyamalan pulls it all together nicely for a rousing finale  and tops it off with a surprising end credits scene guaranteed to leave fans of Unbreakable champing at the bit for the next instalment in what is becoming a delightfully unorthodox superhero series.,positive

Night Shyamalan's ""Split""  which he wrote and directed (both rather clinically)  opens with a distinct ""Silence of the Lambs"" vibe before eventually evolving into a continuation of themes Shyamalan used for his ""Unbreakable"". Three teenage girls in Philadelphia are abducted from a parking lot by a man with dissociative identity disorder; he harbors dozens of personalities--male  female and child--but the final one to present itself is calling for an alliance of ""the horde""  and may represent something superhuman. While the opening scenes do have a familiar ring  they are well-executed by the filmmaker  who gives the audience what its probably hoping for; but Shyamalan  to his credit (although some genre buffs might not be so generous)  is aiming for something loftier than imprisoned girls attempting to escape from a psychotic. The film offers a dissertation on DID via the captor's somewhat-unwitting psychiatrist  who--via Skype!--gives a clinical rundown of the mental disorder to her colleagues (including case studies). None of this information  however interesting  is utilized in the final stretch  as Shyamalan is out to baffle us with a plot-twist that is both confounding and amusing. While ""Split"" is creepy on occasion  it isn't effective as a scary thriller. Maybe Shyamalan feels he's above giving his audience a shock  a jolt  but sometimes a few good clichés are better than a round-table discussion. ** from ****",negative

As several reviewers have already written Night Shyamalan  who started out so well  in fact ""Unbreakable"" is one of my favorite movies  made some real stinkers after a few early hits. So ""Split"" is a return to form  sort of. I didn't count the number of personalities  they say it is 23  but James McAvoy is really  really good as the several distinctly different split personalities. As the movie begins one dad is giving a ride home for his daughter and two friends and  as he finishes loading the trunk of the car someone comes up  drugs him  and drives away with the three girls. It is one of those many personalities.I liked the first 20 minutes or so  and I liked the last 20 minutes or so. The vast hour+ middle has a lot of talking  either the abductor with his psychiatrist or the abductor with his captives. Some things do happen but the great middle of the movie moves very deliberately.Who would really like this movie? Those who like a good character study above all. Shyamalan likes ""twists"" and there are some but mostly unnecessary to the core story of a man fighting with his demons and three young girls trying to regain their freedom.I particularly enjoyed the young actress Anya Taylor-Joy as one of the girls  Casey. Not so much for her acting  which was fine  but she has these wide-set eyes and lips so perfect that they look like they were carved by an artist. Just a totally unique look.Plus I am a fan of Haley Lu Richardson who was one of the girls  Claire. I have seen her in several movies and she is simply a very good actress.SPOILERS: In the end we find that the girls had been held in an underground maintenance area in the Philadelphia zoo  someone found them and the survivors were freed.",negative

It's certainly never boring  but...,27-Jan-17,"Split is a film that asks you to suspend your disbelief  and at first  even after the many films that this director has done where he goes way too far  I was with Split for about the first half of the way through  or maybe more. I knew logically this is not how DID works (Disassociative Identity Disorder)  but hey  it's a movie  let's go with it. And to Shyamalan's credit  he casts the two major parts to the point where it's key and it works. And as a director  overall  and in large part thanks to the cinematographer behind It Follows  it's a film directed with real terror and suspense. It's low-budget  largely a 'bottle' film  and he uses his money with true style. It's paced well... where was I (now I feel like I got this disorder and will become two different critics here  gotta control...)Oh  yeah  James McAvoy  he's fantastic. He may not be playing 23 personalities in total  but the ones that Shyamalan focuses on are developed enough - among them is Barry (a gay fashion designer that McAvoy sort of plays like a young Pacino or something  in the physicality)  Dennis (the one who may seem to be in 'control' and is extremely OCD about any dirt) and Hedwig (who is nine years old  and you can tell) - give McAvoy enough room to explore these personalities. There's times of awkward laughter at first  but this gives way to seeing that McAvoy is so committed to these characters  and is pulling them all of with intensity and charm and disbelief and a madness that is kind of similar to them all  that he's impossible to dislike.Another key player is Ana Taylor Joy  as she's the one of the three girls that we get to know the most (though with this we get into something of a  for me  forced motivation  but I'll get to that later)  and she is on for all of these interactions with McAvoy. She's the one who can somehow speak to Hedwig sympathetically and connect with him  and when she is freaking out and trying to hold things inside  she does this perfectly. Between this and The VVitch she is really on a roll as a major actress for thrillers - she can play terrified  but being in control and being bad-ass works as well. And for a lot of the scenes the actress playing the psychiatrist  Betty Buckley  is believable  as far as she can take the lines to...Okay  here's where we get into the DID here with this movie in reality  it's with its writer AND then also its director. I don't mean the same person  I mean they are separate entities. Shyamalan the director is on top of his game here  with a formal rigor that hasn't clicked this week in well over a decade (it may even connect to Unbreakable  which... oh  more on that at the end of this). Shyamalan the *writer* is something else. He's still someone who thinks he's oh  so  so clever  and you know what? For that first half or so  he kind of is. At least  again  when it comes to the suspension-of-disbelief factor. He does a more than competent job of giving us a believable enough set-up with these girls being held captive  Barry putting up his false front when emailing but then denying anything is wrong to the doctor  and then how the personalities have their splits with the girls and how they are trying (unsuccessfully to escape)... but then Shyamalan the writer gets greedy. Or insane. Or both.The biggest problem here is that this man is CHEATING by the end of this  and in a way that is baffling. He can't have enough with having this somewhat preposterous thriller about a man juggling all these personalities that may lead up to ""The Beast""  the 24th personality. No  it needs to be deeper than that. It also needs to involve child molestation - not just with this man  but the Ana Taylor Joy character when she was younger - and that this  uh  maybe leads into having these super DID powers(!?) He's creating a whacked-out mythology where one needn't exist  and by the time the third act takes off  and you can mark it as soon as the Buckley character comes to Barry/Dennis/Hedwig/Patricia/Et-Al's basement dwelling  it fully goes into bananas territory.I know  I know  it's a thriller  I know I should keep buying into what this is selling... but I just couldn't. Most of all (oh  hell  you got this far in this review) it's the gall to turn this around to make this as part of a  uh  Shyamalan Cinematic Universe with a Bruce Willis Unbreakable cameo that brings me into the 'you're cheating!' territory. Perhaps this is simply this man's M.O. as far as crafting his material  that he can see ahead and know that this is what he has to do  and that everything ties together... or he wrote himself into a corner  realized he was writing sheer insanity as far as where McAvoy goes in this final third  and had to cover up. Either way  it might work for you... or it may feel like him f***ing with all of us. At any rate  all of the material with The Beast has the sensation of Shyamalan as mad mainstream provocateur  like 'hey  how far can I actually take this stuff  you've come this far right  eh  right? RIGHT?!' To his credit  this is a more enjoyable piece of madness than The Village  and its final third makes it something I want to revisit simply to show friends in a 'Look upon this wonder in awe' way like The Happening. I think among the Shyamalan *bad* movies  and this is bad make no mistake  it's directed like a pro and the actors are all on their game  and becomes the best of them.",positive

Here I am  stuck in the middle with the 23 of you,10-Jan-20,"I completely gave up on M. Night Shyamalan between 2005 and 2015. Talking in film titles  that means between ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Visit"". I always thought his supposedly greatest accomplishments ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" were vastly overrated (and even blatant rip-offs of obscure horror gems)  but at least they were watchable. I severely disliked ""Signs"" and absolutely hated ""The Village""  so after that it was exit M. Night for me. From what I read on the internet  he only made rubbish and commercial flops in this 10-year-period anyway. ""Split"" seemed different. It has a more intriguing concept than all of Shyamalan's previous movies combined  and for the very first time  the plot genuinely appeals to fans of dark psycho-thrillers. Usually his stories are balancing on the verge of fantasy and melodrama  with a minor touch of morbidity.The first half of ""Split"" is really good! The script luckily doesn't waste too much time and almost immediately begins with the powerful and intense kidnapping sequence of three teenage girls - in broad daylight on a busy parking lot - by a sinister young man with an evil grimace on his face. The girls  two typically shallow beauties and one introvert girl with a troubled past  are taken to an unknown location and locked up in a sort of basement. What follows next are a good 40-45 minutes of terrific cinema during which the three girls  simultaneously with the audience  gradually learn that their kidnapper isn't just an ordinary maniac but a deeply disturbed schizophrenic with no less than 23 different personalities. The quiet girl  Casey  realizes their only chance for escape is by manipulating the weaker personalities  but there's also a 24th and ultimately evil alter ego brooding within Kevin.Lots of praise and respect for talented young actress Anya Taylor-Joy  and especially for James McAvoy as Barry  Kevin  Dennis  Hedwig  Patricia  etc. Okay  admittedly  it must be a dream come true for any actor to be offered the chance to play a character like this and demonstrate that you are capable of depicting a variety of roles  but still McAvoy puts a lot of passion and devotion in every single twisted personality! My personal favorite is definitely the posh  elderly lady with the dress and necklace. Best male-actor-playing-ugly-old-woman since Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire""  for sure! Sadly  M. Night's true personality also comes to the surface  and not even McAvoy can prevent ""Split"" from slowly turning into a dull and overly talkative B-thriller. Notably the conversations between whatever personality and his therapist are tedious and seem to last endlessly  but also Casey's cliched background story is quite redundant. Not sure what rating ""Split"" received  but the violence and murders all occur off screen  and that is a damn shame! I didn't like the ending (come to think of it  I never like the endings in Shyamalan's movies) but apparently it's the bridge towards a sequel/origin story ""Glass"".",positive

Three young women are kidnapped and held captive by a man suffering with his agonizing 23 different personalities that may even hint toward a 24th. These attractive girls must play their own mind games to find what personality will be of any help in their escape.James McAvoy is outstanding weaving the different personalities.

Always proving to be a most divisive director/writer/actor  Shyamalan has returned to the sort of noticeable form that had him earmarked in his early days as a director to follow - with the proviso that inevitably this is going to still infuriate some for its handling of the subjects at hand.The plot trajectory is simple enough  girls kidnapped by a patient suffering from multiple personality disorder  as the girls in fear try to escape  a number of his personalities put in an appearance. Which builds up to the finale  which explodes after following on from the suspense and dread atmospherics so beloved by the director. In the mix joining the mental health issue with our main protagonist is a good meaning doctor (naturally)  and the spectre of child abuse rears its ugly head. So not a movie to be cheered up by then! While if looking for a detailed and attentive look at the mental health issues to hand you will be disappointed.However  there is a style to the picture in how it draws you into the predicament of the main players  boosted no end by McAvoy on irresistible form. Given licence to chew every scene  he delivers his various characters with great relish and no little amount of skill. Props to for Taylor-Joy  who as the lead kidnappee has deftly blended youthful innocence with resourceful strength (aided by Shyamalan's writing of course). Conversely  Shyamalan is guilty of just making a pic for entertainment purpose  which works as it's a very good creepy thriller with its black humour moments  but the mental health plot devices ensure his gimmicks will not be welcomed by all. 7/10,positive

One is to make the girls and the audience squirm as they're subjected to all type of obscene practises in a torture porn type of tale . The other is to keep the horrors mainly psychological and understated and hope the actor playing the psycho isn't going to have too much fun in the role The good news is that SPLIT isn't torture porn . Even better news is while James McAvoy has fun in the role it's never enough to actually take you out of the movie . McAvoy is of course a Scottish actor from a working class background and it's usually a distraction watching ""one of us"" in a commercial Hollywood movie but here McAvoy delivers a pivotal role playing a character suffering from dissociative identity disorder . Okay it's obvious no one had an eye on the Oscars when this was released and McAvoy's character pieces are a bit episodic along with being intermittently camp but even so the film rests mainly on this performance !!!! TAKE NO CHANCES SUGGESTIVE SPOILER !!!!! M Night Shyamalan is a director whose string of flops over the last few years have made the average audience member totally forget that he was once being touted as the new Spielberg and the temptation to do a sequel to one of his earlier regarded works must have been huge . Instead he concentrates on the understated psychological horrors of the predator and his prey in a slightly above average thriller .
